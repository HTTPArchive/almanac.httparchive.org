# 2021 Resource Hints queries

<!--
  This directory contains all of the 2021 Resource Hints chapter queries.

  Each query should have a corresponding `metric_name.sql` file.
  Note that readers are linked to this directory, so try to make the SQL file names descriptive for easy browsing.

  Analysts: if helpful, you can use this README to give additional info about the queries.
