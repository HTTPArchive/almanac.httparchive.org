# This query uses custom metric '_well-known' - https://github.com/HTTPArchive/legacy.httparchive.org/blob/master/custom_metrics/well-known.js
# Note that in this query, there is a subtle bug where the site could have empty /.well-known/assetlinks.json or /.well-known/apple-app-site-association files which will lead to over counting sites with native app links
# an example is: https://www.allbirds.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json which has a payload of "[]"
# To fix this, this would require response body parsing on well-known.js
