# 2021 Markup queries

<!--
  This directory contains all of the 2021 Markup chapter queries.

  Each query should have a corresponding `metric_name.sql` file.
  Note that readers are linked to this directory, so try to make the SQL file names descriptive for easy browsing.

  Analysts: if helpful, you can use this README to give additional info about the queries.

## File Naming

File names start with the table being queried. Next is the custom metric if appropriate. Then "by" followed by how the query is grouped. Finally anything more specific needed.

## Results

Results are saved in a Google Sheet with one sheet per query. The sheet name should match the query to make it simpler for analysts to follow in the future.
