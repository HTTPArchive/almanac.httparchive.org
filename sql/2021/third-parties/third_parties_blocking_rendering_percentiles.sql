# Third-Party domains which render block paint by percentile
#
# Unlike the blocking main thread queries, light nhouse only contains details if the
# third-party is render blocking (i.e. wastedMs/total_bytes are never 0)
# And also there are no categories given to each third-party
# So we join to the usual almanac.third_parties table to get those totals and categories
#
# Based heavily on research by Houssein Djirdeh:
