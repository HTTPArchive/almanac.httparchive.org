## Caveats

The CMS category in Wappalyzer may not necessarily contain everything we consider to be a CMS. For example, some ecommerce platforms like Webflow and Shopify [could be argued](https://github.com/AliasIO/wappalyzer/pull/4729) belong in the CMS category.

There were also a couple of CMSs whose detections were broken as of July 2021: Duda and MyWebsite. We've excluded these from the top 10 charts to avoid showing misleading results.
