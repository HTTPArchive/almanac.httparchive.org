# Question What is the prevalence of correctly configured /.well-known/change-password endpoints?
# Notes: Safe Cast is required `.data.status` is not always an INT for some reason

# Prevalence of correctly configured /.well-known/change-password endpoints:
# defined as `change-password` redirecting and having an 'ok' HTTP status code (https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#ok-status),
# while `resource-that-should-not-exist-whose-status-code-should-not-be-200` indeed does not have status code 200,
# as this would indicate that the server is badly configured, and that the redirect to `change-password` can't be trusted.
# `status` reflects the status code after redirection, so checking only for the status code afterwards is fine.
