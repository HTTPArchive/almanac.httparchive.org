# Section: Drivers of security mechanism adoption - Location of a website
# Question: How is security feature adoption and location of a website related (i.e. which is the most common country visiting that website)?
# Note: Security feature adoption grouped by sites frequently visited from different countries
# Note: Not all headers have their individual percentages
# Note: Currenly uses regex search on respOtherHeaders that can have false positives if a header name is used as a value of a header; could use the new response_header struct instead
# Note: Only on the main document (is_main_document)
