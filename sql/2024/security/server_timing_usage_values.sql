# Section: Security misconfigurations and oversights - (Missing) suppression of 'Server-Timing' header
# Question: Which are the most common server-timing headers and how often are they used in total?
# Note: Probably better to split some of the things up to make the interpretation of the results easier
# Note: Server-Timing sent to same-origin/top-level requests is not an issue, maybe only look at non first-party requests?
