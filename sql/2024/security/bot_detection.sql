# Section: Attack Preventions - Bot protection services
# Question: Which bot protection services are used most often on mobile and desktop sites?
# Notes: The Wappalyzer 'Security' category mostly contains bot protection services such as reCAPTCHA and Cloudflare Bot Management
# Issue: Due to some updates to wappalyzer the 'Security' category now also contains 'HSTS' (security header) and 'Really Simple SSL & Security' in significant numbers. Do we want to filter them out?
