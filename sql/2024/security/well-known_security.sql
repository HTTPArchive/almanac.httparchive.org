  # Section: Well-known URIs - securityt.txt
  # Question: What is the prevalence of (signed) /.well-known/security.txt endpoints and prevalence of included attributes (canonical, encryption, expires, policy)?
  # Note: Query is huge (60TB) and computationally expensive (slow)
  # Note: We require that the final status code for /.well-known/security.txt is 200 (found) and that the content-type starts with text/plain. This can lead to a very small number of false negatives but is much better than false positives using other approaches
  # Note: all_required_exist = contact & expires are mandatory; only_one_requirement_broken = expires & preferred_languages are not allowed to occur multiple times; valid = all_required_exist && !only_one_requirement_broken
  # Note: The custom metric only has an entry for a directive if it is not empty, thus we can assume that a non-null value cannot be an empty list
  # Note: Each directive (except signed) is saved as a list, however currently we do not really check the content
