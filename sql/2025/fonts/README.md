## Structure

The queries are split by the section where they are used:

* `design/` is about foundries and families,
* `development/` is about tools and technologies, and
* `performance/` is about hosting and serving.

Each file name starts with one of the following prefixes indicating the primary subject of the corresponding analysis:

* `fonts_` is about font files,
* `pages_` is about HTML pages,
* `scripts_` is about JavaScript scripts, and
* `styles_` is about CSS style sheets.

The prefix is followed by the property studied given in singular, potentially extended one or several suffixes narrowing down the scope, as in `fonts_size_by_table.sql` and `pages_link_relation.sql`.

## Content

Each query starts with a preamble indicating the section, question, and normalization type, as illustrated below:

```sql
-- Section: Performance
-- Question: What is the distribution of the file size broken down by table?
-- Normalization: Pages
```

Many queries rely on temporary functions for convenience and clarity. The functions that appear in several queries are extracted into a common file called `common.sql`. Whenever any of the functions defined in `common.sql` is used by a query, the query has the following pseudo-directive at the top:

```sql
-- INCLUDE https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/blob/main/sql/{year}/fonts/common.sql
```

The pseudo-directive has to be replaced with the content of `common.sql` prior to executing the query in question.

In addition, queries generally have parameters, as in `@date`, so as to be able to run them for different configurations. The values for the parameters will have to be supplied upon execution.

All the above is taken take of automatically if the queries are executed using `execute.py`, which we discuss next.

## Execution

The queries can be executed using the `execute.py` script. First, ensure that the Application Default Credentials authorization strategy is configured, and that the HTTP Archive project is used as the quota project:

```shell
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project httparchive
```

Second, install the Python prerequisites for the script:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The script can be run for all or a subset of the queries as illustrated below:

```shell
python execute.py
python execute.py design/*.sql
python execute.py development/fonts_*.sql
```

By default, it operates in a dry-run mode: it does not run the queries but prints an estimate of the amount of data that would be processed by each query. To actually run the queries, pass the `--no-dry-run` option as follows:

```shell
python execute.py --no-dry-run
python execute.py --no-dry-run design/*.sql
python execute.py --no-dry-run development/fonts_*.sql
```
