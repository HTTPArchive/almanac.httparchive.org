-- Web Almanac — Audio elements with <track> usage (2025)
--
-- This query:
--   • Uses `httparchive.crawl.pages` at the site level (client × is_root_page).
--   • Extracts <audio> counts and <audio><track> counts from the _almanac JSON payload.
--   • Counts sites with any audio and sites with audio tracks.
--   • Computes percentages:
--       - pct_audios_with_tracks      = SUM(total_with_track) / SUM(total_audios)
--       - pct_sites_with_audios       = sites_with_audio / total_sites
--       - pct_audio_sites_with_tracks = sites_with_tracks / sites_with_audio
--   • Groups results by client (desktop/mobile) and is_root_page (TRUE/FALSE).
