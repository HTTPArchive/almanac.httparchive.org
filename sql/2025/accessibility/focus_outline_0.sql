# Web Almanac — Adoption of :focus pseudoclass and outline: 0 style (2025-07-01)
# Google Sheet: focus_outline_0
#
# Purpose
#   • Measure how many pages define custom styles for the :focus pseudoclass.
#   • Identify how often those styles also disable focus outlines with `outline: 0`.
#
# Method
#   1. Read parsed CSS JSON from `httparchive.crawl.parsed_css`.
#   2. Extract top-level rules and one level of nested rules (@media etc.) using
#        JSON_QUERY_ARRAY(css, '$.stylesheet.rules') and UNION ALL.
#   3. For each page:
#        - sets_focus_style      = TRUE if any selector includes ":focus"
#        - sets_focus_outline_0  = TRUE if any :focus rule declares "outline: 0"
#   4. Aggregate to count pages per {client}, then join with total page counts
#      from `httparchive.crawl.pages`.
#   5. Compute percentages of pages that set focus styles or set outline: 0.
#
# Output columns
#   client                   — "desktop" | "mobile"
#   pages_focus              — number of pages with a :focus style
#   pages_focus_outline_0    — number of pages with :focus + outline: 0
#   total_pages              — total distinct pages per client
#   pct_pages_focus          — fraction of pages with :focus style
#   pct_pages_focus_outline_0 — fraction with :focus + outline: 0
#
# Key change from 2024 query
#   • Removed the JavaScript UDF (getFocusStylesOutline0) that parsed CSS via
#     an external library (css-utils.js).
#   • Replaced with native BigQuery JSON functions:
#       - JSON_QUERY_ARRAY() to iterate rules, selectors, and declarations.
#       - JSON_VALUE() to extract scalar strings for LIKE and equality checks.
#   • This makes the query cheaper, more portable, and avoids row-by-row JS.
#   • Query structure (focus_data, total_pages_data, final SELECT) is preserved
#     to mirror the 2024 original for comparability.
