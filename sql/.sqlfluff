# L003 - We don't agree wiht their UNION alignment. Revisit on next release thanks to https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/pull/1257
# L007 - We like our ANDs at the end. Revisit on next release if https://github.com/sqlfluff/sqlfluff/issues/1261 is resolved
# L011 - We don't always alias tables with AS ("FROM table1 AS tb1" instead of "FROM table1 tb1"). Do for columns but not for tables.
# L014 - Unquoted identifiers (e.g. column names) will be mixed case so don't enforce case
# L016 - We allow longer lines as some of our queries are complex. Maybe should limit in future?
# L020 - Asks for unique table aliases meaning it complains if selecting from two 2021_07_01 tables as implicit alias is table name (not fully qualified) so same.
# L026 - BigQuery uses arrays and functions which looks like incorrect references
# L027 - Asks for qualified columns for ambiguous. Really should enable this but a lot to clean up. TODO
# L028 - Insists on references in column names even if not ambiguous. Bit OTT.
# L029 - Avoids keywords as identifiers but has some common ones we use (e.g. count, element).
# L030 - Function names will be mixed case so don't enforce case
# L031 - Avoid aliases in from and join - why?
# L032 - Uses joins instead of USING - why?
# L034 - Inisits on wildcards (*) in certain SELECT order - why?
# L035 - Do not use ELSE NULL as redudant. But it's clearer!?
# L036 - Select targets should be on new lines but sub clauses don't always obey this. Maybe revisit in future?
# L037 - if using DESC in one ORDER BY column, then insist on ASC/DESC for all.
# L042 - Use CTEs instead of subqueries. We don't use this consistently and big rewrite to do that.
# L043 - Use coalesce instead of case if you can. But it's clearer!?
# L048 - Doesn't work with "AS '''" that we use in our LANGUAGE declarations
