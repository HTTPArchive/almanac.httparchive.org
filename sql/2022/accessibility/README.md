# 2022 Accessibility queries

The majority of 2022 accessibility queries here copies from the [2021 accessibility queries](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/tree/main/sql/2021/accessibility), with a few exceptions copied from other chapters:

- From CSS 2022: `units_properties.sql`
- From CSS 2022: `media_query_features.sql`
- From CSS 2021: `focus_visible.sql` (with minor perf-related change)
- From CSS 2021: `focus_outline_0.sql` (note this doesn‚Äôt include the 2021 variant `focus_outline_0_or_none.sql`, which didn‚Äôt make it to the published report)
- From Mobile Web 2022: `viewport_zoom_scale.sql` (already copied in 2021 queries)
- From Mobile Web 2022: `viewport_zoom_scale_by_domain_rank.sql`

Note out of the 44 2021 accessibility queries, we only copied the two thirds that were used in the published report.
