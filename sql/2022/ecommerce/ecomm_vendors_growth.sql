# 13_04: Timeseries to show eCommerce vendors growth over the year
# Excluding apps which are not eCommerce platforms/vendors themselves but are used to identify eCommerce sites. These are signals added in Wappalyzer in 2020 to get better idea on % of eCommerce sites but these are not relevant for vendor % market share analysis
# Limiting to top 5000 records to continue further analysis in Google Sheets. Using HAVING clauses based on 'pct' results in missing data for certain months
