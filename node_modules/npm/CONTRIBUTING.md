## Code of Conduct

All interactions in the **npm** organization on GitHub are considered to be covered by our standard [Code of Conduct](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct).

## Development

**1. Clone this repository...**

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:npm/cli.git
```

**2. Navigate into project & install development-specific dependencies...**

```bash
$ cd ./npm && npm install
```

**3. Write some code &/or add some tests...**

```bash

```

**4. Run tests & ensure they pass...**

```

**5. Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/npm/cli/pulls) for your work & become the newest contributor to `npm`! ðŸŽ‰**

## Test Coverage

We expect that every new feature or bug fix comes with corresponding tests that validate the solutions. We strive to have as close to, if not exactly, 100% code coverage.

**You can find out what the current test coverage percentage is by running...**

```bash
$ npm run test-coverage
```

## Performance & Benchmarks

We've set up an automated [benchmark](https://github.com/npm/benchmarks) integration that will run against all Pull Requests; Posting back a comment with the results of the run.

**Example:**

## Reporting Bugs

When submitting a new bug report, please first [search](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues) for an existing or similar report & then use one of our existing [issue templates](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/new/choose) if you believe you've come across a unique problem. Duplicate issues, or issues that don't use one of our templates may get closed without a response.
