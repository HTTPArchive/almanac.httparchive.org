### Synopsis

```bash
npm bugs [<pkgname> [<pkgname> ...]]

aliases: issues
```

### Description

This command tries to guess at the likely location of a package's bug
tracker URL, and then tries to open it using the `--browser` config param.
If no package name is provided, it will search for a `package.json` in the
current folder and use the `name` property.

### Configuration

#### browser

* Default: OS X: `"open"`, Windows: `"start"`, Others: `"xdg-open"`
* Type: String or Boolean

The browser that is called by the `npm bugs` command to open websites.

Set to `false` to suppress browser behavior and instead print urls to
terminal.

Set to `true` to use default system URL opener.

#### registry

* Default: https://registry.npmjs.org/
* Type: url

The base URL of the npm package registry.
