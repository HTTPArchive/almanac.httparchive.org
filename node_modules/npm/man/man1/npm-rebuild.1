.SS Description
.P
This command runs the \fBnpm build\fP command on the matched folders\.  This is
useful when you install a new version of node, and must recompile all your
C++ addons with the new binary\.  It is also useful when installing with
\fB\-\-ignore\-scripts\fP and \fB\-\-no\-bin\-links\fP, to explicitly choose which
packages to build and/or link bins\.
.P
If one or more package names (and optionally version ranges) are provided,
then only packages with a name and version matching one of the specifiers
will be rebuilt\.
