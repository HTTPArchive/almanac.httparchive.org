\fBnpm-run-script\fR \- Run arbitrary package scripts

npm run\-script <command> [\-\-if\-present] [\-\-silent] [\-\- <args>]

aliases: run, rum, urn

.SS Description
.P
This runs an arbitrary command from a package's \fB"scripts"\fP object\.  If no
\fB"command"\fP is provided, it will list the available scripts\.
.P
\fBrun[\-script]\fP is used by the test, start, restart, and stop commands, but
can be called directly, as well\. When the scripts in the package are
printed out, they're separated into lifecycle (test, start, restart) and
directly\-run scripts\.
.P
Any positional arguments are passed to the specified script\.  Use \fB\-\-\fP to
pass \fB\-\fP\-prefixed flags and options which would otherwise be parsed by npm\.
.P
For example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm run test \-\- \-\-grep="pattern"
.fi
.RE
.P
The arguments will only be passed to the script specified after \fBnpm run\fP
and not to any \fBpre\fP or \fBpost\fP script\.
.P
The \fBenv\fP script is a special built\-in command that can be used to list
environment variables that will be available to the script at runtime\. If an
"env" command is defined in your package, it will take precedence over the
built\-in\.
.P
In addition to the shell's pre\-existing \fBPATH\fP, \fBnpm run\fP adds
\fBnode_modules/\.bin\fP to the \fBPATH\fP provided to scripts\. Any binaries
provided by locally\-installed dependencies can be used without the
\fBnode_modules/\.bin\fP prefix\. For example, if there is a \fBdevDependency\fP on
\fBtap\fP in your package, you should write:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
"scripts": {"test": "tap test/*\.js"}
.fi
.RE

instead of
.P
.RS 2
.nf
"scripts": {"test": "node_modules/\.bin/tap test/*\.js"}
.fi
.RE
.P
The actual shell your script is run within is platform dependent\. By default,
on Unix\-like systems it is the \fB/bin/sh\fP command, on Windows it is
\fBcmd\.exe\fP\|\.
The actual shell referred to by \fB/bin/sh\fP also depends on the system\.
You can customize the shell with the \fBscript\-shell\fP configuration\.
.P
Scripts are run from the root of the package folder, regardless of what the
current working directory is when \fBnpm run\fP is called\. If you want your
script to use different behavior based on what subdirectory you're in, you
can use the \fBINIT_CWD\fP environment variable, which holds the full path you
were in when you ran \fBnpm run\fP\|\.
.P
\fBnpm run\fP sets the \fBNODE\fP environment variable to the \fBnode\fP executable
with which \fBnpm\fP is executed\. Also, if the \fB\-\-scripts\-prepend\-node\-path\fP is
passed, the directory within which \fBnode\fP resides is added to the \fBPATH\fP\|\.
If \fB\-\-scripts\-prepend\-node\-path=auto\fP is passed (which has been the default
in \fBnpm\fP v3), this is only performed when that \fBnode\fP executable is not
found in the \fBPATH\fP\|\.
.P
If you try to run a script without having a \fBnode_modules\fP directory and it
fails, you will be given a warning to run \fBnpm install\fP, just in case you've
forgotten\.

You can use the \fB\-\-if\-present\fP flag to avoid exiting with a non\-zero exit code
when the script is undefined\. This lets you run potentially undefined scripts
without breaking the execution chain\.

Optional custom script to use to execute the command\. If not defined defaults
