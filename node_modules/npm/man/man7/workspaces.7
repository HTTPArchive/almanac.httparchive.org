\fBworkspaces\fR \- Working with workspaces
.SS Description
.P
\fBWorkspaces\fR is a generic term that refers to the set of features in the
npm cli that provides support to managing multiple packages from your local
files system from within a singular top\-level, root package\.
.P
This set of features makes up for a much more streamlined workflow handling
linked packages from the local file system\. Automating the linking process
as part of \fBnpm install\fP and avoiding manually having to use \fBnpm link\fP in
order to add references to packages that should be symlinked into the current
\fBnode_modules\fP folder\.
.P
We also refer to these packages being auto\-symlinked during \fBnpm install\fP as a
single \fBworkspace\fR, meaning it's a nested package within the current local
file system that is explicitly defined in the npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP
\fBworkspaces\fP configuration\.
.SS Installing workspaces
.P
Workspaces are usually defined via the \fBworkspaces\fP property of the
npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP file, e\.g:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
  "name": "my\-workspaces\-powered\-project",
  "workspaces": [
    "workspace\-a"
  ]
}
.fi
.RE
.P
Given the above \fBpackage\.json\fP example living at a current working
directory \fB\|\.\fP that contains a folder named \fBworkspace\-a\fP that disposes
of a \fBpackage\.json\fP inside it, defining a nodejs package, e\.g:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
\|\.
+\-\- package\.json
`\-\- workspace\-a
   `\-\- package\.json
.fi
.RE
.P
The expected result once running \fBnpm install\fP in this current working
directory \fB\|\.\fP is that the folder \fBworkspace\-a\fP will get symlinked to the
\fBnode_modules\fP folder of the current working dir\.
.P
Below is a post \fBnpm install\fP example, given that same previous example
structure of files and folders:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
\|\.
+\-\- node_modules
|  `\-\- workspace\-a \-> \.\./workspace\-a
+\-\- package\-lock\.json
+\-\- package\.json
`\-\- workspace\-a
   `\-\- package\.json
.fi
.RE
.SS Using workspaces
.P
Given the specifities of how Node\.js handles module resolution \fIhttps://nodejs\.org/dist/latest\-v14\.x/docs/api/modules\.html#modules_all_together\fR it's possible to consume any defined workspace
by it's declared \fBpackage\.json\fP \fBname\fP\|\. Continuing from the example defined
above, let's also create a Node\.js script that will require the \fBworkspace\-a\fP
example module, e\.g:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
// \./workspace\-a/index\.js
module\.exports = 'a'

// \./lib/index\.js
const moduleA = require('workspace\-a')
console\.log(moduleA) // \-> a
.fi
.RE
.P
When running it with:
.P
\fBnode lib/index\.js\fP
.P
This demonstrates how the nature of \fBnode_modules\fP resolution allows for
\fBworkspaces\fR to enable a portable workflow for requiring each \fBworkspace\fR
in such a way that is also easy to npm help publish these
nested workspaces to be consumed elsewhere\.
