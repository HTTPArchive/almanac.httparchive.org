{% block mission %}
Our mission is to combine the raw stats and trends of the HTTP Archive with the expertise of the web community. The Web Almanac is a comprehensive report on the state of the web, backed by real data and trusted web experts. It is comprised of 20 chapters spanning aspects of page content, user experience, publishing, and distribution.

{% block methodology_description %}
Unless otherwise noted, the metrics in all of the 20 chapters of the Web Almanac are sourced from the HTTP Archive dataset. HTTP Archive is a community-run project that has been tracking how the web is built since 2010. Using WebPageTest and Lighthouse under the hood, metadata about nearly 6 million websites are tested monthly and included in a public BigQuery database for analysis. The July 2019 dataset was used as the basis for the Web Almanac's metrics. For more information, see the Methodology page.
