<!--{# IMPORTANT!

- `chapter.html` is a "template for templates" used by the `generate_chapters.js` script, hence the strange template syntax (eg, mixing ejs and jinja syntax)
- if you want to modify `chapter.html`, you must also:
  - translate the corresponding language-specific templates (eg `src/templates/<lang>/<year>/chapter.html`)
  - run the generation script to update each chapter template
- if you want to modify the chapter templates (eg `src/templates/<lang>/<year>/chapters/<chapter>.html`):
  - make changes to the markdown content directly (`src/content/<lang>/<year>/<chapter>.md`) because any changes to the chapter templates will be overwritten by the generation script

        In 2005, Ian "Hixie" Hickson posted
        <a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060203035414/http://code.google.com/webstats/index.html"
          >some analysis of markup data</a

        building upon various previous work. Much of this work aimed to
        investigate class names to see if there were common informal semantics
        that were being adopted by developers which it might make sense to
        standardize upon. Some of this research helped inform new elements in
        HTML5.
      </p>
      <p>
        14 years later, it's time to take a fresh look. Since then, we've also
        had the introduction of Custom Elements and the
        <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/"
          >Extensible Web Manifesto</a
        >
        encouraging that we find better ways to pave the cowpaths by allowing
        developers to explore the space of elements themselves and allow
        standards bodies to<a

        >
          act more like dictionary editors</a
        >. Unlike CSS class names which might be used for anything, we can be
        far more certain that authors who used a non-standard
        <em>element</em> really intended this to be an element.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of July 2019, the HTTP Archive has begun collecting all used
        <em>element</em> names in the DOM for about 4.4 million desktop home
        pages, and about 5.3 million mobile home pages which we can now begin to
        research and dissect.
      </p>
      <p>
        This crawl encountered
        <em>over 5000 distinct non-standard element names</em> in these pages,
        so we capped the total distinct number of elements that we count to the
        'top' (explained below) 5048.
      </p>
      <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        Names of elements on each page were collected from the DOM itself, post
        initial run of JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at a raw frequency count isn't especially helpful, even for
        standard elements: About 25% of all elements encountered are
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. About 17% are <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, about
        10.6% are <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> -- and those are the only elements
        that account for more than 10% of occurrences. Languages are
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE"
          >generally like this</a
        >, a small number of terms are astoundingly used by comparison. Further,
        when we start looking at non-standard elements for uptake, this would be
        very misleading as one site could use a certain element a thousand times
        and thus make it look artificially very popular.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, as in Hixie's original study, what we will look at is how many
        sites include each element at least once in their homepage (Note: This
        is, itself, not without some potential biases. Popular products can be
        used by several sites, which introduce non-standard markup, even
        'invisibly' to individual authors. Thus, care must be taken to
        acknowledge that usage doesn't necessarily imply direct author knowledge
        and conscious adoption as much as it does the servicing of a common
        need, in a common way. During our research, we found several examples of
        this, some we will call out.)
      </p>
      <h2 id="top-elements-and-general-info">Top elements and general info</h2>
      <p>
        In 2005, Hixie's survey listed the top few most commonly used elements
        on pages. The top 3 were <code>html</code>, <code>head</code> and
        <code>body</code> which he noted as interesting because they are
        optional and created by the parser if omitted. Given that we use the
        post-parsed DOM, they'll show up universally in our data. Thus, we'll
        begin with the 4th most used element. Below is a comparison of the data
        from then to now (I've included the frequency comparison here as well
        just for fun).

      <h2 id="custom-elements">Custom elements?</h2>
      <p>
        Most of the elements we recorded are custom (as in simply 'not
        standard'), but discussing which elements are and are not custom can get
        a little challenging. Written down in some spec or proposal somewhere
        are, actually, quite a few elements. For purposes here, we considered
        244 elements as standard (though, some of them are deprecated or
        unsupported):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>145 Elements from HTML</li>
        <li>68 Elements from SVG</li>
        <li>31 Elements from MathML</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In practice, we encountered only 214 of these:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>137 from HTML</li>
        <li>54 from SVG</li>
        <li>23 from MathML</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the desktop dataset we collected data for the top 4,834 non-standard
        elements that we encountered. Of these:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          155 (3.21%) are identifiable as very probable markup or escaping
          errors (they contain characters in the parsed tag name which imply
          that the markup is broken)
        </li>
        <li>
          341 (7.05%) use XML-style colon namespacing (though, as HTML, they
          don't use actual XML namespaces)
        </li>
        <li>3207 (66.44%) are valid custom element names</li>
        <li>
          1211 (25.05%) are in the global namespace (non-standard, having
          neither dash, nor colon)
          <ul>
            <li>
              216 of these we have flagged as *possible *typos as they are
              longer than 2 characters and have a Levenshtein distance of 1 from
              some standard element name like <code>&lt;cript&gt;</code>,<code
                >&lt;spsn&gt;</code
              >
              or <code>&lt;artice&gt;</code>. Some of these (like
              <code>&lt;jdiv&gt;</code>), however, are certainly intentional.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, 15% of desktop pages and 16% of mobile pages contain
        deprecated elements (NOTE: A lot of this is very likely due to the use
        of products rather than individual authors continuing to manually create
        this markup.), here's the most common 10 and the number of pages they
        appear on in each setâ€¦

      <p>
        In order to discuss numbers about the use of elements (standard,
        deprecated or custom), we first need to establish some perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        The top 150 element names, counting the number of pages where they
        appear, are shown in this chart:

      ></iframe>
      <p>Note how quickly use drops off.</p>
      <p>
        11 elements occur in over 90% <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only 15 more elements occur in at least 50% of the home pages
        (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> are the others).
      </p>
      <p>And only 40 more elements occur on more than 5% of pages.</p>
      <p>
        Even <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, for example, doesn't make that cut. It
        appears on only 4.21% of pages in the dataset (on desktop, only 3.03% on
        mobile). While these numbers sound very low, 4.21% is actually
        <em>quite</em> popular by comparison. In fact, only 98 elements occur on
        more than 1% of pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's interesting, then, to look at what the distribution of these
        elements looks like and which ones have more than 1% use. Below is a
        chart that shows the rank of each element and which category they fall
        into. I've separated the data points into discrete sets simply so that
        they can be viewed (otherwise there just aren't enough pixels to capture
        all that data), but they represent a single 'line' of popularity - the
        left-most being the most common, the right-most being the least common.
        The arrow points to the end of elements that appear in more than 1% of
        the pages.

      <p>
        You can observe two things here: First, that the set of elements that
        have more than 1% use are not exclusively HTML. In fact,
        <em>27 of the most popular 100 elements aren't even HTML</em> - they are
        SVG! And there are
        <em>non-standard tags at or very near that cutoff too</em>! Second, note
        that a whole lot of HTML elements are used by less than 1% of pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, are all of those elements used by less than 1% of pages "useless?".
        Definitely not. This is why establishing perspective matters. There are
        around
        <a
          href="https://www.websitehostingrating.com/internet-statistics-facts/"
          >2 billion web sites on the web</a
        >. If something appears on 0.1% of all websites in our dataset, we can
        extrapolate that this represents perhaps <em>2 million web sites</em> in
        the whole web. Even 0.01% extrapolates to a
        <em>two hundred of thousand of sites</em>. This is also why removing
        support for elements, even very old ones which we think aren't great
        ideas, is a very rare occurrence: Breaking hundreds of thousands or
        millions of sites just isn't a thing that browser vendors can do
        lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, lots of elements, even the native ones, have less than 1% use and
        are still very important and successful. <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, for
        example, is an element that I both use and encounter a lot. It's
        definitely useful and important - and yet it is used on only 0.57% of
        these pages. Part of this is skewed based on what we are measuring -
        home pages are generally <em>less likely</em> to include certain kinds
        of things (like <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> for example): They serve a
        less general purpose than, for example, headings, paragraphs, links and
        lists, however, the data is generally useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also collected information about which pages contained an author
        defined (not native) <code>.shadowRoot</code> -- About 0.22% of the
        pages on desktop, and 0.15% on mobile. This might not sound like a lot,
        but it is roughly 6.5k sites in the mobile dataset and 10k sites on the
        desktop and is more than several HTML elements.
        <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> for example, has about equivalent use on
        the desktop and it is the 146th most popular element.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>&lt;datalist&gt;</code> appeared in 0.04% of homepages, it is the
        201st most popular element.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, over 15% of elements we're counting as defined by HTML are
        outside the top 200 in the desktop dataset .
        <code>&lt;meter&gt;</code> is the least popular "HTML5 era" element
        (2004-2011, before HTML moved to a Living Standard model): It is around
        the 1000th most popular element. <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>, the most
        recently introduced element (April 2016), is only around the 1400th most
        popular element.

      <p>
        With this perspective in mind about what use of native/standard features
        looks like in the dataset, let's talk about the non-standard stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might expect that lots of elements we recorded are used only on a
        single domain, but in fact, no element we're talking about in this list
        of 5048 elements is used on only a single domain. The least number of
        domains an element in our dataset appears in is 15. About a fifth of
        them occur on more than 100 domains. About 7% occur on more than 1000
        domains.

        To help analyze the data, I hacked together a

        As in Hixie's original research, it seems that several of the extremely

        In his original paper, Hixie mentions that "The good thing, if we can be
        forgiven for trying to remain optimistic in the face of all this
        non-standard markup, is that at least these elements are all clearly
        using vendor-specific names. This massively reduces the likelihood that
        standards bodies will invent elements and attributes that clash with any
        of them." However, as mentioned above, this is not universal. Over 25%
        of the non-standard elements that we captured don't use any kind of
        namespacing strategy to avoid polluting the global namespace. Here is
        <a
          href="https://rainy-periwinkle.glitch.me/permalink/53567ec94b328de965eb821010b8b5935b0e0ba316e833267dc04f1fb3b53bd5.html"

        are obscure names, misspellings and so on -- but at least a few probably
        present some challenges. You'll note, for example, that
        <code>&lt;toast&gt;</code> (which Googlers

        The interesting thing about these is that they also introduce a few
        other ways that our tool can come in very handy: If we're interested in
        exploring the space of the data, a very specific tag name is just one
        possible measure. It's definitely the strongest indicator if we can find
        good slang developing. However, what if that's not all we're interested

        What if, for example, we were interested in people solving common use
        cases? This could be because we're looking for solutions to use cases
        that we currently have ourselves, or for researching more broadly what
        common use cases people are solving with an eye toward incubating some
        standardization effort. Let's take a common example: Tabs. Over the
        years there have been a lot of requests for things like tabs. We can use
        a fuzzy search here and find that there are

        If we notice popular things pop up (like <code>&lt;jdiv&gt;</code>,
        solving chat) we can take knowledge of things we know (like, that that
        is what <code>&lt;jdiv&gt;</code> is about, or
        <code>&lt;olark&gt;</code>) and try to look

      <h3 id="in-summary">In Summary</h3>
      <p>So, there's lots of data here, but to summarize:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pages have more elements than they did 14 years ago -- both on average
          and max.
        </li>
        <li>
          The lifetime of things on home pages is <em>very</em> long.
          Deprecating or discontinuing things doesn't make them go away, and it
          might never.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a lot of broken markup out there in the wild (misspelled
          tags, missing spaces, bad escaping, misunderstandings)
        </li>
        <li>
          Measuring what 'useful' means is tricky -- lots of native elements
          don't pass the 5% bar, or even the 1% bar, but lots of custom ones do
          -- and for lots of reasons. Passing 1% should definitely grab our
          attention at least, but perhaps so should 0.5% because that is,
          according to the data, comparatively <em>very</em> successful.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is already a ton of custom markup out there. It comes in a lot
          of forms, but elements containing a dash definitely seem to have taken
          off.
        </li>
        <li>
          We need to increasingly study this data and come up with good
          observations to help find and pave the cowpaths.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That last one is where you come in: We'd love to tap into the creativity
        and curiosity of the larger community to help explore this data using
        some of the tools (like
        <a href="https://rainy-periwinkle.glitch.me/"
          >https://rainy-periwinkle.glitch.me/</a
        >) -- please share your interesting observations and help build our
        commons of knowledge and understanding.
