<!--{# IMPORTANT!

- `chapter.html` is a "template for templates" used by the `generate_chapters.js` script, hence the strange template syntax (eg, mixing ejs and jinja syntax)
- if you want to modify `chapter.html`, you must also:
  - translate the corresponding language-specific templates (eg `src/templates/<lang>/<year>/chapter.html`)
  - run the generation script to update each chapter template
- if you want to modify the chapter templates (eg `src/templates/<lang>/<year>/chapters/<chapter>.html`):
  - make changes to the markdown content directly (`src/content/<lang>/<year>/<chapter>.md`) because any changes to the chapter templates will be overwritten by the generation script

      <p>
        Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are a new class of web applications, building
        on top of platform primitives <br />
        like the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API"
          >Service Worker APIs</a
        >. <br />
        Service workers allow apps to support network-independent loading by
        acting as a network proxy, <br />
        intercepting your web app's outgoing requests, and replying with
        programmatic or cached responses. <br />
        Service workers can receive push notifications, and synchronize data in
        the background even when <br />
        the corresponding app is not running. Additional, service workers —
        together with <br />
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest"
          >Web App Manifests</a
        >
        — <br />
        allow users to install PWAs to their devices’ home screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Service workers were
        <a
          href="https://blog.chromium.org/2014/12/chrome-40-beta-powerful-offline-and.html"
          >first implemented in Chrome 40</a
        >, <br />
        back in December 2014, and the term Progressive Web Apps was <br />
        <a
          href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/"
          >coined by Frances Berriman and Alex Russell</a
        >
        <br />
        in 2015. As service workers are now finally
        <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/"
          >implemented in all major browsers</a
        >, <br />
        we were wondering how many PWAs are actually out there, and how do they
        make use of these new technologies? <br />
        Certain advanced APIs like
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync"
          >Background Sync</a
        >
        <br />
        are currently still
        <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=background-sync"
          >only available on Chromium-based browsers</a
        >, <br />
        so as an additional question, we looked into which features these PWAs
        actually use.
      </p>
      <p>
        All data in the HTTP Archive can be
        <a
          href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/legacy.httparchive.org/blob/master/docs/bigquery-gettingstarted.md"
          >queried through BigQuery</a
        >,<br />
        where multiple tables are available in the
        <code>httparchive</code> project. As these tables tend to get fairly
        big, <br />
        they are partitioned, but multiple associated tables can be queried
        using the
        <a
          href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-wildcard-tables"
          >wildcard symbol '*'</a
        >.<br />
        For our research, three families of tables are relevant:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>httparchive.lighthouse.*</code>, which contains data about
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/"
            >Lighthouse</a
          >
          runs. Note that Lighthouse data is only available for mobile pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>httparchive.pages.*</code>, which contain the JSON-encoded
          parent documents’ HAR data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>httparchive.response_bodies.*</code>, which contains the raw
          response bodies of all resources and sub-resources of all sites in the
          archive.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Service Worker Registrations and Installability
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first metric we explore are service worker installations. Looking at
        the data exposed through <br />
        feature counters in the HTTP Archive, we find that 0.44% of all desktop
        and 0.37% of all mobile pages <br />
        register a service worker, and both curves over time are steeply
        growing. Now this might not look overly <br />
        impressive, but taking traffic data from Chrome Platform Status into
        account, we can see that about <br />
        <a
          href="https://www.chromestatus.com/metrics/feature/timeline/popularity/990"
          >a service worker controlled 15% of all page loads</a
        >,<br />
        which can be interpreted as popular, high-traffic sites increasingly
        having started to embrace service workers.

      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at Lighthouse data in the HTTP Archive, 1.56% of mobile pages
        are
        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/install-prompt"
          >installable</a
        >,<br />
        that is, they pass Lighthouse’s
        <em>user can be prompted to install the web app</em> test. <br />
        Lighthouse tests currently are only available for mobile pages. To
        control the install experience, <br />
        0.82% of all desktop and 0.94% of all mobile pages use the

      <h3 id="service-worker-events">Service Worker Events</h3>
      <p>

        <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/lifecycle"
          >listen for a number of events</a
        >:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>install</code>, which occurs upon service worker installation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>activate</code>, which occurs upon service worker activation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>fetch</code>, which occurs whenever a resource is fetched.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>push</code>, which occurs when a push notification arrives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>notificationclick</code>, which occurs when a notification is
          being clicked.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>notificationclose</code>, which occurs when a notification is
          being closed.<br />
          <code>- message</code>, which occurs when a message sent via
          <code>postMessage()</code> arrives.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>sync</code>, which occurs when a Background Sync event occurs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We have examined which of these events are being listened to by service
        workers we could find in the HTTP Archive. <br />
        The results for mobile and desktop are very similar with
        <code>fetch</code>, <code>install</code>, and
        <code>activate</code> being the three <br />
        most popular events, followed by <code>notificationclick</code> and
        <code>push</code>. If we interpret these results, offline use <br />
        cases that service workers enable are the most attractive feature for
        app developers, far ahead of <br />
        push notifications. Due to its limited availability, and less common use
        case, background sync doesn’t <br />
        play a significant role at the moment.

      <h3 id="service-worker-file-sizes">Service Worker File Sizes</h3>
      <p>
        File size or lines of code are in general a bad proxy for the complexity
        of the task at hand. <br />
        In this case, however, it is definitely interesting to compare
        (compressed) file sizes of service workers <br />
        for mobile and desktop. The median service worker file on desktop is 895
        bytes, whereas on mobile it’s 694 bytes. <br />
        Throughout all percentiles desktop service workers are larger than
        mobile service workers. <br />
        We note that these stats don’t account for dynamically imported scripts
        through the <br />
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/importScripts"
          ><code>importScripts()</code></a
        >
        method, <br />
        which likely skews the results higher.

      <h3 id="web-app-manifest-properties">Web App Manifest Properties</h3>
      <p>
        The web app manifest is a simple JSON file that tells the browser about
        a web application <br />
        and how it should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or
        desktop. A typical <br />
        manifest file includes information about the app name, icons it should
        use, the start URL <br />
        it should open at when launched, and more. Only 1.54% of all encountered
        manifests were <br />
        invalid JSON, and the rest parsed correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We looked at the different properties defined by the <br />
        <a href="https://w3c.github.io/manifest/#webappmanifest-dictionary"
          >specification</a
        >, <br />
        and also considered non-standard proprietary properties. According to
        the Web App Manifest spec, <br />
        the following properties are allowed: <code>dir</code>,
        <code>lang</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>short_name</code>,
        <code>description</code>, <br />
        <code>icons</code>, <code>screenshots</code>, <code>categories</code>,
        <code>iarc_rating_id</code>, <code>start_url</code>,
        <code>display</code>, <code>orientation</code>, <br />
        <code>theme_color</code>, <code>background_color</code>,
        <code>scope</code>, <code>serviceworker</code>,
        <code>related_applications</code>, and <br />
        <code>prefer_related_applications</code>. The only property that we
        didn’t observe in the wild was <br />
        <code>iarc_rating_id</code>, which is a string that represents the
        International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) <br />
        certification code of the web application. It is intended to be used to
        determine which ages <br />
        the web application is appropriate for. The proprietary properties we
        encountered still <br />
        frequently were <code>gcm_sender_id</code> and
        <code>gcm_user_visible_only</code> from the legacy <br />
        Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service. Interestingly there’re almost no
        differences between mobile <br />
        and desktop. On both platforms, however, there’s a long tail of
        properties that are not interpreted <br />
        by browsers but that contain potentially useful metadata like
        <code>author</code> or <code>version</code>. We also found <br />
        a non-trivial amount of mistyped properties, our favorite being
        <code>shot_name</code>. An interesting outlier <br />
        is the <code>serviceworker</code> property which is standard, but not
        implemented by any browser vendor — <br />
        nevertheless, it was found on 0.09% of all web app manifests used by
        mobile and desktop pages.

      <h3 id="display-values">Display Values</h3>
      <p>
        Looking at the values developers set for the
        <code>display</code> property, it becomes immediately clear <br />
        that they want PWAs to be perceived as “proper” apps that don’t reveal
        their web technology origins. <br />
        By choosing <code>"standalone"</code>, they make sure no browser UI is
        shown to the end-user. This is reflected <br />
        by the majority of apps that make use of the
        <code>prefers_related_applications</code> property: more that 97% <br />
        of both mobile and desktop applications do <em>not</em> prefer native
        applications.

      <h3 id="category-values">Category Values</h3>
      <p>
        The <code>categories</code> member describes the expected application
        categories to which the web application belongs. <br />
        It is only meant as a hint to catalogs or stores listing web
        applications, and it is expected that <br />
        these will make a best effort to find appropriate categories (or
        category) under which to list the <br />
        web application. There were not too many manifests that made use of the
        property, but it is <br />
        interesting to see the shift from <em>shopping</em> being the most
        popular category on mobile to <em>business</em>, <br />
        <em>technology</em>, and <em>web</em> (whatever may be meant with that)
        on desktop that share the first place evenly.

        Workbox is a set of libraries that help with common service worker use
        cases. For instance, Workbox has tools <br />
        that can plug in to your build process and generate a manifest of files,
        which are then precached by your <br />
        service worker. Workbox includes libraries to handle runtime caching,
        request routing, cache expiration, <br />
        background sync, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the low-level nature of the service worker APIs, many developers
        have turned to Workbox as a way of <br />
        structuring their service worker logic into higher-level, reusable
        chunks of code. Workbox adoption is also <br />
        driven by its inclusion as a feature in a number of popular JavaScript
        framework starter kits, like <br />
        <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/"
          ><code>create-react-app</code></a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/cli-plugin-pwa"
          >Vue's PWA plugin</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The HTTP Archive shows that, out of the total population of sites that
        register a service worker, <br />
        12.71% of them are using at least one of the Workbox libraries. This
        percentage is roughly consistent <br />
        across desktop and mobile, with a slightly lower percentage (11.46%) on
        mobile compared to desktop (14.36%).
