<!--{# IMPORTANT!

- `chapter.html` is a "template for templates" used by the `generate_chapters.js` script, hence the strange template syntax (eg, mixing ejs and jinja syntax)
- if you want to modify `chapter.html`, you must also:
  - translate the corresponding language-specific templates (eg `src/templates/<lang>/<year>/chapter.html`)
  - run the generation script to update each chapter template
- if you want to modify the chapter templates (eg `src/templates/<lang>/<year>/chapters/<chapter>.html`):
  - make changes to the markdown content directly (`src/content/<lang>/<year>/<chapter>.md`) because any changes to the chapter templates will be overwritten by the generation script

      <p>Nearly 10% of the home pages in this study were found to be on an ecommerce platform. An "ecommerce platform" is a set of software or services that enables you to create and operate an online store. There are several types of ecommerce platforms, for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Paid-for services</strong> such as <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> that host your store and help you get started. They provide website hosting, site and page templates, product-data management, shopping carts and payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Software platforms</strong> such as <a href="https://magento.com/products/magento-open-source">Magento Open Source</a> which you set up, host and manage yourself. These platforms can be powerful and flexible, but may be more complex to set up and run than services such as Shopify.</li>
        <li><strong>Hosted platforms</strong> such as <a href="https://magento.com/products/magento-commerce">Magento Commerce</a> that offer the same features as their self-hosted counterparts, except that hosting is managed as a service by a third party.</li>
      </ul>
      <figure id="fig-1">
        <div class="big-number">10%</div>
        <figcaption>Figure 1. Percent of pages on an ecommerce platform.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This analysis could only detect sites built on an ecommerce platform. This means that most large online stores and marketplaces—such as Amazon, JD, and eBay—are not included here. Also note that the data here is for home pages only: not category, product or other pages. Learn more about our <a href="./methodology">methodology</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="platform-detection">Platform detection</h2>
      <p>How do we check if a page is on an ecommerce platform?</p>
      <p>Detection is done through <a href="./methodology#wappalyzer">Wappalyzer</a>. Wappalyzer is a cross-platform utility that uncovers the technologies used on websites. It detects <a href="./cms">content management systems</a>, ecommerce platforms, web servers, <a href="./javascript">JavaScript</a> frameworks, <a href="./third-parties">analytics</a> tools, and many more.</p>
      <p>Page detection is not always reliable, and some sites explicitly block detection to protect against automated attacks. We might not be able to catch all websites that use a particular ecommerce platform, but we're confident that the ones we do detect are actually on that platform.</p>

      <p>Out of the 116 ecommerce platforms that were detected, only six are found on more than 0.1% of desktop or mobile websites. Note that these results do not show variation by country, by size of site, or other similar metrics.</p>
      <p>Figure 3 above shows that WooCommerce has the largest adoption at around 4% of desktop and mobile websites. Shopify is second with about 1.6% adoption. Magento, PrestaShop, Bigcommerce, and Shopware follow with smaller and smaller adoption, approaching 0.1%.</p>

        <div id="fig8-caption" class="visually-hidden">Distribution of the 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90th percentiles of requests per ecommerce page. The median desktop ecommerce page makes 108 requests. The 10th percentile is 53 requests, 25th 76, 75th 153, and 90th 210. Desktop websites are slightly higher than mobile by about 10 requests.</div>
        <figcaption>Figure 8. Distribution of requests per ecommerce page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The median desktop ecommerce platform page loads 108 requests and 2.7 MB. The median weight for <em>all</em> desktop pages is 74 requests and <a href="./page-weight#page-weight">1.9 MB</a>. In other words, ecommerce pages make nearly 50% more requests than other web pages, with payloads around 35% larger. By comparison, the <a href="https://amazon.com">amazon.com</a> home page makes around 300 requests on first load, for a page weight of around 5 MB, and <a href="https://ebay.com">ebay.com</a> makes around 150 requests for a page weight of approximately 3 MB. The page weight and number of requests for home pages on ecommerce platforms is slightly smaller on mobile at every percentile, but around 10% of all ecommerce home pages load more than 7 MB and make over 200 requests.</p>
      <p>This data accounts for home page payload and requests without scrolling. Clearly there are a significant proportion of sites that appear to be retrieving more files (the median is over 100), with a larger total payload, than should be necessary for first load. See also: <a href="#third-party-requests-and-bytes">Third party requests and bytes</a> below.</p>
      <p>We need to do further research to better understand why so many home pages on ecommerce platforms make so many requests and have such large payloads. The authors regularly see home pages on ecommerce platforms that make hundreds of requests on first load, with multi-megabyte payloads. If the number of requests and payload are a problem for performance, then how can they be reduced?</p>

      <p>Images constitute the largest number of requests and the highest proportion of bytes for ecommerce pages. The median desktop ecommerce page includes 39 images weighing 1,514 KB (1.5 MB).</p>
      <p>The number of <a href="./javascript">JavaScript</a> requests indicates that better bundling (and/or <a href="./http2">HTTP/2</a> multiplexing) could improve performance. JavaScript files are not significantly large in terms of total bytes, but many separate requests are made. According to the <a href="./http2#user-content-adoption-of-http2">HTTP/2</a> chapter, more than 40% of requests are not via HTTP/2. Similarly, CSS files have the third highest number of requests but are generally small. Merging CSS files (and/or HTTP/2) could improve performance of such sites. In the authors' experience, many ecommerce pages have a high proportion of unused CSS and JavaScript. <a href="./media">Videos</a> may require a small number of requests, but (not surprisingly) consume a high proportion of the page weight, particularly on sites with heavy payloads.</p>

      <p>Note that HTML payloads may include other code such as inline JSON, JavaScript, or CSS directly in the markup itself, rather than referenced as external links.

      <p>Mobile HTML payload sizes are not very different from desktop. In other words, it appears that sites are not delivering significantly different HTML files for different devices or viewport sizes. On many ecommerce sites, home page HTML payloads are large. We don't know whether this is because of bloated HTML, or from other code (such as JSON) within HTML files.</p>

      <p>Note that the data here is for page load without scrolling.</p>
      <p>This shows that the median page on an ecommerce platform (for home pages from the Web Almanac data) has 37 images and an image payload of 1,517.16 KB on mobile, 40 images and 1,524.56 KB on desktop. 10% of home pages have 90 or more images and an image payload of nearly 6&nbsp;MB.</p>
      <p>A significant proportion of home pages on ecommerce platforms have sizeable image payloads and make a large number of image requests on first load. See <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images">httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images</a> for context on the state of images globally, and also the <a href="./media">media</a> and <a href="./page-weight">page weight</a> chapters. Website owners want their sites to look good on modern devices. As a result, many sites deliver the same high resolution product images to every user without regard for screen resolution or size. Developers may not be aware of (or not want to use) responsive techniques that enable efficient delivery of the best possible image to different users. It's worth remembering that high-resolution images may not necessarily increase conversion rates. Conversely, overuse of heavy images is likely to impact page speed and can&nbsp;thereby <em>reduce</em> conversion rates. In the authors' experience from site reviews and events, some developers and other stakeholders have SEO or other concerns about using lazy loading for images.</p>
      <p>We need to do more analysis to better understand why some sites are not using responsive image techniques or lazy loading. We also need to provide guidance that helps ecommerce platforms to reliably deliver beautiful images to those with high end devices and good connectivity — while providing a best-possible experience to lower-end devices and those with poor connectivity.</p>

      <aside class="note">Note that some image services or CDNs will automatically deliver WebP (rather than JPEG or PNG) to platforms that support WebP, even for a URL with a `.jpg` or `.png` suffix. For example, this URL will return a WebP image in Chrome: [IMG_20190113_113201.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/webdotdev/f_auto/w_500/IMG_20190113_113201.jpg). However, HTTP Archive image format detection is done by checking for keywords in the MIME type first, then falling back to the file extension. The code for format detection is [here](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/legacy.httparchive.org/blob/31a25b9064a365d746d4811a1d6dda516c0e4985/bulktest/batch_lib.inc#L994). This means that the format for images with URLs such as the above will be given as WebP, since WebP is supported by HTTP Archive as a user agent.</aside>
      <h3 id="png">PNG</h3>
      <p>The high number of PNG requests from pages on ecommerce platforms is probably for product images. Many commerce sites use PNG with photographic images to enable transparency.</p>
      <p>Using WebP with a PNG fallback can be a far more efficient alternative, either via a <a href="http://simpl.info/picturetype">picture element</a> or by using user agent capability detection via an image service such as <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/webdotdev/f_auto/w_500/IMG_20190113_113201.jpg">Cloudinary</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="webp">WebP</h3>
      <p>The data shows very few sites on ecommerce platforms using WebP, which tallies with the authors' experience of site reviews and partner work. WebP is <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=webp">supported by all modern browsers other than Safari</a> and has good fallback mechanisms available. WebP supports transparency and is a far more efficient format than PNG for photographic images (see PNG section above).</p>
      <h3 id="pushing-to-use-webp-more">Pushing to use WebP more</h3>
      <p>We as a web community can provide better guidance/advocacy for enabling transparency using WebP with a PNG fallback and/or using WebP/JPEG with a solid color background. WebP appears to be rarely used on ecommerce platforms even though several guides to WebP usage are available (such as <a href="https://web.dev/serve-images-webp">web.dev/serve-images-webp</a>) as well as apps and tools including <a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp">cwebp</a>. We need to do further research into why there hasn't been more take-up of WebP, which is now <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2010/09/webp-new-image-format-for-web.html">nearly 10 years old</a>.</p>

      <p>The median ('mid-range') dimensions for images requested by home pages on ecommerce platforms is 247x196 px on mobile and 240x192 px on desktop. 10% of images requested by home pages on ecommerce platforms are at least 693x512 px on mobile and 800x546 px on desktop.</p>
      <p>Note that these dimensions are the intrinsic sizes of images, not their display size. The median dimensions for images on ecommerce platforms are 247x196 px on mobile, 240x192 px on desktop though 10% of images for pages on ecommerce platforms are at least 693x512 px on mobile and 800x546 px on desktop.</p>
      <p>Given that image dimensions at each percentile up to the median are similar on mobile and desktop, or even slightly <em>larger</em> on mobile in some cases, it would seem that many sites are not delivering different image dimensions for different viewports — in other words, not using responsive image techniques. The delivery of <em>larger</em> images to mobile in some cases may (or may not!) be explained by sites using device or screen detection.</p>
      <p>We need to do more research into why many sites are (apparently) not delivering different image sizes to different viewports.</p>
      <h2 id="third-party-requests-and-bytes">Third party requests and bytes</h2>
      <p>Many websites — especially online stores — load a significant amount of code and content from third parties: for analytics, A/B testing, customer behavior tracking, advertising and social media support. Third party content can have a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/loading-third-party-javascript">significant impact on performance</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickhulce">Patrick Hulce</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/patrickhulce/third-party-web">third-party-web tool</a> is used to determine third party requests for this report, and this is discussed more in the [./third-party](Third Party chapter) written by Patrick.</p>

      <p>Platforms such as Shopify may extend their services using client-side JavaScript, whereas other platforms such as Magento use more server side extensions. This difference in architecture affects the figures seen here.</p>
      <p>Clearly, home pages on some platforms make more requests for third party content and incur a larger total third party payload. Further analysis could be completed on why home pages from some platforms make more requests and have larger third party payloads than others.</p>

      <p>'Total pages' is the total number of home pages retrieved while data was being gathered for this study. For example, 135,290 desktop requests were for home pages on sites built using the WooCommerce platform. <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/first-contentful-paint">First Contentful Paint</a> measures the time it takes from navigation until content such as text or an image is first displayed. In this context, 'fast' means FCP in under one second, 'slow' means FCP in 2.5 seconds or more, 'average' is everything in between. Note that third party content and code may have a significant impact on FCP.</p>
      <p>All top-six ecommerce platforms have worse FCP on mobile than desktop: less 'fast', more 'slow'. Note that FCP is affected by device capability (processing power, memory, etc.) as well as connectivity.</p>
      <p>We need to establish why FCP is worse on mobile than desktop. What are the causes: connectivity and/or device capability — or something else?</p>

Less than 20% of home pages on ecommerce platforms get a score of more than 50 and less than 1% of home pages score more than 60.</p>
      <p>Lighthouse returns a Progressive Web App (PWA) score between zero and 100. Zero is the worst possible score, and 100 is the best. The PWA audits are based on the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist">Baseline PWA Checklist</a>, which lists 14 requirements. Lighthouse has automated audits for 11 of the 14 requirements. The remaining 3 can only be tested manually. Each of the 11 automated PWA audits are weighted equally, so each one contributes approximately 9 points to your PWA score.</p>
      <p>If at least one of the PWA audits got a null score, Lighthouse nulls out the score for the entire PWA category. This was the case for 2.32% of home pages.</p>
      <p>Clearly, most home pages on ecommerce platforms are failing most <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist">PWA checklist audits</a>. We need to do further analysis to better understand which audits are failing and why.</p>
      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This comprehensive study of ecommerce usage for the sites crawled by HTTP Archive shows some interesting data and also the wide variations in ecommerce sites - even those built on the same ecommerce platform. Even though we have gone into a lot of detail here, there is much more analysis we could do in this space. For example, we didn't get accessibility scores this year (checkout the <a href="./accessibility">accessibility chapter</a> for more on that). Next year, we should look at this and likewise, for geographical data. This study detected 246 ad providers on home pages on ecommerce platforms. Further studies (perhaps in next year's Web Almanac?) could calculate what proportion of sites on ecommerce platforms shows ads. WooCommerce got very high numbers in this study so another interesting statistic we could look at next year is if some hosting providers are installing WooCommerce but not enabling it, thereby causing inflated figures.</p>
