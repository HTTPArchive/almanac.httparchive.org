    <h1>
      Introducing the <b>Web Almanac</b>, coming November 2019.
    </h1>

    <p>
      The Web Almanac is HTTP Archive's annual "state of the web" report.
      Our mission is to combine the powerful analytics of HTTP Archive with the
      expertise of the web community. The Almanac is made up of four primary
      sections: page content, user experience, content delivery, and
      content distribution. Each section is comprised of chapters that explore
      the state of specific areas like JavaScript usage, accessibility,
      content management systems, and compression.
