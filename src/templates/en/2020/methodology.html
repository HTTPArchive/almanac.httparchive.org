        <h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview" class="anchor-link">Overview</a></h2>

        <p>
          The Web Almanac is a project organized by <a href="https://httparchive.org">HTTP Archive</a>. HTTP Archive was started in 2010 by Steve Souders with the mission to track how the web is built. It evaluates the composition of millions of web pages on a monthly basis and makes its terabytes of metadata available for analysis on <a href="https://httparchive.org/faq#how-do-i-use-bigquery-to-write-custom-queries-over-the-data">BigQuery</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Web Almanac's mission is to become an annual repository of public knowledge about the state of the web. Our goal is to make the data warehouse of HTTP Archive even more accessible to the web community by having subject matter experts provide contextualized insights.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 2020 edition of the Web Almanac is broken into four parts: content, experience, publishing, and distribution. Within each part, several chapters explore their overarching theme from different angles. For example, Part II explores different angles of the user experience in the Performance, Security, and Accessibility chapters, among others.
        </p>

        <h2 id="dataset"><a href="#dataset" class="anchor-link">About the dataset</a></h2>

        <p>
          The HTTP Archive dataset is continuously updating with new data monthly. For the 2020 edition of the Web Almanac, unless otherwise noted in the chapter, all metrics were sourced from the August 2020 crawl. These results are <a href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/httparchive.org/blob/master/docs/gettingstarted_bigquery.md">publicly queryable</a> on BigQuery in tables prefixed with <code>2020_08_01</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of the metrics presented in the Web Almanac are publicly reproducible using the dataset on BigQuery. You can browse the queries used by all chapters in our <a href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/tree/main/sql/2020">GitHub repository</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          Please note that some of these queries are quite large and can be <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing">expensive</a> to run yourself, as BigQuery is billed by the terabyte.

        <h3 id="websites"><a href="#websites" class="anchor-link">Websites</a></h3>

        <p>
          There are 7,546,709 websites in the dataset. Among those, 6,347,919 are mobile websites and 5,593,642 are desktop websites. Most websites are included in both the mobile and desktop subsets.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTTP Archive sources the URLs for its websites from the <a href="#chrome-ux-report">Chrome UX Report</a>. The Chrome UX Report is a public dataset from Google that aggregates user experiences across millions of websites actively visited by Chrome users. This gives us a list of websites that are up-to-date and a reflection of real-world web usage. The Chrome UX Report dataset includes a form factor dimension, which we use to get all of the websites accessed by desktop or mobile users.
        </p>

        <p>
          The August 2020 HTTP Archive crawl used by the Web Almanac used the most recently available Chrome UX Report release for its list of websites. The 202006 dataset was released on July 14, 2020 and captures websites visited by Chrome users during the month of June.
        </p>

        <p>
          There was was a 20-30% growth in the number of websites analyzed compared to those in the <a href="../2019/methodology#websites">2019 Web Almanac</a>. This increase has been analyzed by <a href="{{ url_for('contributors', year=year, lang=lang, _anchor='paulcalvano') }}">Paul Calvano</a> in his <a href="https://paulcalvano.com/2020-09-29-growth-of-the-web-in-2020/">Growth of the Web in 2020</a> post.
        </p>

        <p>
          Due to resource limitations, the HTTP Archive can only test one page from each website in the Chrome UX report. To reconcile this, only the home pages are included. Be aware that this will introduce some bias into the results because a home page is not necessarily representative of the entire website.
        </p>

        <p>
          HTTP Archive is also considered a lab testing tool, meaning it tests websites from a datacenter and does not collect data from real-world user experiences. All pages are tested with an empty cache in a logged out state, which may not reflect how real users would access them.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="metrics"><a href="#metrics" class="anchor-link">Metrics</a></h3>

      <p>
        HTTP Archive collects thousands of metrics about how the web is built. It includes basic metrics like the number of bytes per page, whether the page was loaded over HTTPS, and individual request and response headers. The majority of these metrics are provided by <a href="#webpagetest">WebPageTest</a>, which acts as the test runner for each website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other testing tools are used to provide more advanced metrics about the page. For example, <a href="#lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> is used to run audits against the page to analyze its quality in areas like accessibility and SEO. The <a href="#tools">Tools</a> section below goes into each of these tools in more detail.
      </p>

      <p>
        To work around some of the inherent limitations of a lab dataset, the Web Almanac also makes use of the <a href="#chrome-ux-report">Chrome UX Report</a> for metrics on user experiences, especially in the area of web performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some metrics are completely out of reach. For example, we don't necessarily have the ability to detect the tools used to build a website. If a website is built using create-react-app, we could tell that it uses the React framework, but not necessarily that a particular build tool is used. Unless these tools leave detectible fingerprints in the website's code, we're unable to measure their usage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other metrics may not necessarily be impossible to measure but are challenging or unreliable. For example, aspects of web design are inherently visual and may be difficult to quantify, like whether a page has an intrusive modal dialog.

        The Web Almanac is made possible with the help of the following open source tools.

      <h3 id="webpagetest"><a href="#webpagetest" class="anchor-link">WebPageTest</a></h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a> is a prominent web performance testing tool and the backbone of HTTP Archive. We use a <a href="https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest-docs/blob/master/user/Private%20Instances/README.md">private instance</a> of WebPageTest with private test agents, which are the actual browsers that test each web page. Desktop and mobile websites are tested under different configurations:

        Desktop websites are run from within a desktop Chrome environment on a Linux VM. The network speed is equivalent to a cable connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mobile websites are run from within a mobile Chrome environment on an emulated Moto G4 device with a network speed equivalent to a 3G connection. Note that the emulated mobile User Agent self-identifies as Chrome 65 but is actually Chrome 84 under the hood.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two locations from which tests are run: California and Oregon USA. HTTP Archive maintains its own test agent hardware located in the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> datacenter in California. Additional test agents in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/#locations">Google Cloud Platform</a>'s us-west-1 location in Oregon are added as needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        HTTP Archive's private instance of WebPageTest is kept in sync with the latest public version and augmented with <a href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/legacy.httparchive.org/tree/master/custom_metrics">custom metrics</a>. These are snippets of JavaScript that are evaluated on each website at the end of the test. Thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/legacy.httparchive.org/commits/master/custom_metrics">contributions</a> of many data analysts, especially the <a href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/legacy.httparchive.org/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ATiggerito+sort%3Acreated-asc">herculean efforts</a> of <a href="{{ url_for('contributors', year=year, lang=lang, _anchor='Tiggerito') }}">Tony McCreath</a>, the 2020 edition of the Web Almanac greatly expanded the capabilities of HTTP Archive's test infrastructure with over 3,000 lines of new code.

      <p>
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a> is an automated website quality assurance tool built by Google. It audits web pages to make sure they don't include user experience antipatterns like unoptimized images and inaccessible content.
      </p>

      <p>
        HTTP Archive runs the latest version of Lighthouse for all of its mobile web pages — desktop pages are not included because of limited resources. As of the August 2020 crawl, HTTP Archive used the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/releases/tag/v6.2.0">6.2.0</a> version of Lighthouse.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lighthouse is run as its own distinct test from within <a href="#webpagetest">WebPageTest</a>, but it has its own configuration profile:

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.wappalyzer.com/">Wappalyzer</a> is a tool for detecting technologies used by web pages. There are <a href="https://www.wappalyzer.com/technologies">64 categories</a> of technologies tested, ranging from JavaScript frameworks, to CMS platforms, and even cryptocurrency miners. There are over 1,400 supported technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        HTTP Archive runs the latest version of Wappalyzer for all web pages. As of August 2020 the Web Almanac used the <a href="https://github.com/AliasIO/Wappalyzer/releases/tag/v6.2.0">6.2.0 version</a> of Wappalyzer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wappalyzer powers many chapters that analyze the popularity of developer tools like WordPress, Bootstrap, and jQuery. For example, the <a href="{{ url_for('chapter', year=year, lang=lang, chapter='ecommerce') }}">Ecommerce</a> and <a href="{{ url_for('chapter', year=year, lang=lang, chapter='cms') }}">CMS</a> chapters rely heavily on the respective <a href="https://www.wappalyzer.com/categories/ecommerce">Ecommerce</a> and <a href="https://www.wappalyzer.com/categories/cms">CMS</a> categories of technologies detected by Wappalyzer.
      </p>

      <p>
        All detection tools, including Wappalyzer, have their limitations. The validity of their results will always depend on how accurate their detection mechanisms are. The Web Almanac will add a note in every chapter where Wappalyzer is used but its analysis may not be accurate due to a specific reason.

      <p>
        The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report">Chrome UX Report</a> is a public dataset of real-world Chrome user experiences. Experiences are grouped by websites' origin, for example <code>https://www.example.com</code>. The dataset includes distributions of UX metrics like paint, load, interaction, and layout stability. In addition to grouping by month, experiences may also be sliced by dimensions like country-level geography, form factor (desktop, phone, tablet), and effective connection type (4G, 3G, etc.).
      </p>

      <p>
        For Web Almanac metrics that reference real-world user experience data from the Chrome UX Report, the August 2020 dataset (202008) is used.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can learn more about the dataset in the <a href="https://web.dev/chrome-ux-report-bigquery">Using the Chrome UX Report on BigQuery</a> guide on <a href="https://web.dev/">web.dev</a>.

      </p>

      <p>
        Domains are considered to be a third party provider if they appear on at least 50 unique pages. The project also groups providers by their respective services in categories like ads, analytics, and social.
      </p>

      <p>
        Several chapters in the Web Almanac use the domains and categories from this dataset to understand the impact of third parties.

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/reworkcss/css">Rework CSS</a> is a JavaScript-based CSS parser. It takes entire stylesheets and produces a JSON-encoded object distinguishing each individual style rule, selector, directive, and value.
      </p>

      <p>
        This special purpose tool significantly improved the accuracy of many of the metrics in the <a href="{{ url_for('chapter', year=year, lang=lang, chapter='css') }}">CSS</a> chapter. CSS in all external stylesheets and inline style blocks for each page were parsed and queried to make the analysis possible. See <a href="https://discuss.httparchive.org/t/analyzing-stylesheets-with-a-js-based-parser/1683">this thread</a> for more information about how it was integrated with the HTTP Archive dataset on BigQuery.

      <p>
        This year's <a href="{{ url_for('chapter', year=year, lang=lang, chapter='css') }}">CSS</a> chapter led by <a href="{{ url_for('contributors', year=year, lang=lang, _anchor='LeaVerou') }}">Lea Verou</a> took a significantly more detailed look at the state of CSS, spread over <a href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/tree/main/sql/2020/01_CSS">100+ queries</a>. For perspective, that's 2.5x more queries than in 2019. To make this scale of analysis feasible, Lea open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/rework-utils">Rework Utils</a>. These utilities take the JSON data from Rework to the next level by providing helpful scripts to more easily extract CSS insights. Most of the stats you see in the CSS chapter are powered by these scripts.

      <p>
        The Web Almanac took about a year to plan and execute with the coordination of more than a hundred <a href="{{ url_for('contributors', year=year, lang=lang) }}">contributors</a> from the web community. This section describes why we chose the chapters you see in the Web Almanac, how their metrics were queried, and how they were interpreted.

      <h3 id="planning"><a href="#planning" class="anchor-link">Planning</a></h3>

      <p>
        The 2020 Web Almanac kicked off in <a href="https://twitter.com/rick_viscomi/status/1273135952848977920">June 2020</a>, later than the 2019 timeline due to the unrest related to COVID-19 and the social justice protests. These and other events of 2020 were an undercurrent throughout the entire production process and put a lot of additional strain on our contributors beyond the stresses of a fast-paced project like this.
      </p>

      <p>
        As we <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/methodology#brainstorming">stated in last year's Methodology</a>:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        One explicit goal for future editions of the Web Almanac is to encourage even more inclusion of underrepresented and heterogeneous voices as authors and peer reviewers.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        To that end, this year we've made systematic changes to the way that we seek and select authors:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Previous authors were specifically discouraged from writing again to make room for different perspectives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone endorsing 2020 authors were asked to be especially conscious not to nominate people who all look or think alike.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many 2019 authors were Google employees and this year we tried to get a greater balance of perspectives from the broader web community. We believe that the voices in the Web Almanac should be a reflection of the community itself, and not skewed towards any specific company to avoid creating echo chambers.
        </li>
        <li>
          The project leads reviewed all of the author nominations and made an effort to select authors who will bring new perspectives and amplify the voices of underrepresented groups in the community.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We hope to iterate on this process in the future to ensure that the Web Almanac is a more diverse and inclusive project with contributors from all backgrounds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, in July 2020, after rounds of brainstorming and nominations, 22 chapters were solidified and we formed content teams for each chapter tasked with writing, reviewing, and analysis.

      <h3 id="analysis"><a href="#analysis" class="anchor-link">Analysis</a></h3>

      <p>
        In July and August 2020, with the stable list of metrics and chapters, data analysts triaged the metrics for feasibility. In some cases, <a href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/legacy.httparchive.org/tree/master/custom_metrics">custom metrics</a> were created to fill gaps in our analytic capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout August 2020, the HTTP Archive data pipeline crawled several million websites, gathering the metadata to be used in the Web Almanac.
      </p>

      <p>
        The data analysts began writing queries to extract the results for each metric. In total, hundreds of queries were written by hand! You can browse all of the queries by year and chapter in our open source <a href="https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/tree/main/sql/2020">query repository</a> on GitHub.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3 id="interpretation"><a href="#interpretation" class="anchor-link">Interpretation</a></h3>

      <p>
        Authors worked with analysts to correctly interpret the results and draw appropriate conclusions. As authors wrote their respective chapters, they drew from these statistics to support their framing of the state of the web. Peer reviewers worked with authors to ensure the technical correctness of their analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        To make the results more easily understandable to readers, web developers and analysts created data visualizations to embed in the chapter. Some visualizations are simplified to make the points more clearly. For example, rather than showing a full distribution, only a handful of percentiles are shown. Unless otherwise noted, all distributions are summarized using percentiles, especially medians (the 50th percentile), and not averages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, editors revised the chapters to fix simple grammatical errors and ensure consistency across the reading experience.

      <p>
        The 2020 edition of the Web Almanac is the second in what we hope to continue as an annual tradition in the web community of introspection and a commitment to positive change. Getting to this point has been a monumental effort thanks to many dedicated <a href="{{ url_for('contributors', year=year, lang=lang) }}">contributors</a> and we hope to leverage as much of this work as possible to make future editions even more streamlined.
