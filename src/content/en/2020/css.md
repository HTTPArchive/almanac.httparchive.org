## Introduction

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to lay out, format, and paint web pages and other media. It is one of the three main languages for building websites, the other two being HTML, used for structure, and JavaScript, used to specify behavior.

In [last year’s inaugural Web Almanac](../2019/), we looked at [a variety of CSS metrics](../en/2019/css) measured through 41 SQL queries over the HTTP Archive corpus, to assess the state of the technology in 2019. This year, we went a lot deeper, to measure not only how many pages use a given CSS feature, but also *how* they use it.

Overall, what we observed was a Web in two different gears when it comes to CSS adoption. In our blog posts and twitter bubbles, we tend to mostly discuss the newest and shiniest. However, there are still *millions* of sites using decade-old code. Things like [vendor prefixes from a bygone era](#vendor-prefixes), [proprietary IE filters](#filters), and [floats for layout](#layout), in all their [clearfix](#class-names) glory. But we also observed impressive adoption of many new features, even features that only got support across the board this very year, like [`min()` and `max()`](#feature-queries). However, there is generally an inverse correlation between how cool something is perceived to be and how much it's actually used, e.g. cutting-edge Houdini features were practically nonexistent.

Similarly, in our conference talks, we often tend to focus on complicated, elaborate use cases that make heads explode and twitter feeds fill with "CSS can do *that*?!". However, as it turns out, most CSS usage in the wild is fairly simple. [CSS Variables are mostly used as constants](#complexity) and rarely refer to other variables, `calc()` is [mostly used with two terms](#calculations), gradients [mostly have two stops](#gradients) and so on.

The Web is not a teenager any more. It is now 30 years old, and acts like it. It tends to favor stability over new bling, and readability over complexity, occasional guilty pleasures aside.

## Methodology

The [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/) crawls [millions of pages](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web#numUrls) every month and runs them through a private instance of [WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/) to store key information of every page. (You can learn more about this in our [methodology](./methodology)).

For this year, we decided to involve the community in which metrics to study. We started with an [app to propose metrics and vote on them](https://projects.verou.me/mavoice/?repo=leaverou/css-almanac&labels=proposed%20stat). In the end, there were so many interesting metrics that we ended up including nearly all of them. We only excluded Font metrics, since there is a whole separate [Fonts chapter](./fonts) and there was significant overlap.

The data in this chapter took 121 SQL queries to produce, totaling over 10K lines of SQL, which includes 3K lines of JS, making it the largest chapter in Web Almanac's history.

A lot of engineering work went into making this scale of analysis feasible. Like last year, we put all CSS code through a [CSS parser](https://github.com/reworkcss/css), and stored the [Abstract Syntax Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST) for all stylesheets in the corpus, resulting in a whopping 10 TB of data. This year, we also developed a [library of helpers](https://github.com/leaverou/rework-utils) that operate on this AST, and a [selector parser](https://projects.verou.me/parsel), both of which were also released as separate open source projects. Most metrics involved [JS](https://github.com/LeaVerou/css-almanac/tree/master/js) to collect data from a single AST, and [SQL](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/tree/main/sql/2020/01_CSS) to aggregate this data over the entire corpus. Curious how your own CSS does against our metrics? We made an [online playground](https://projects.verou.me/css-almanac/playground) where you can try them out on your own sites.

For certain metrics, looking at the CSS AST was not enough. We wanted to look at [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) wherever it was provided via sourcemaps as it shows us what developers *need* from CSS that is not yet possible, whereas studying CSS shows us what developers currently use that is. For that, we had to use a *custom metric*, i.e. JS code that runs in the crawler when it visits a given page. We could not use a proper SCSS parser as that could slow down the crawl too much, so we had to resort to [regular expressions](https://github.com/LeaVerou/css-almanac/blob/master/runtime/sass.js) (*oh, the horror!*). Despite the crude approach, we got [a plethora of insights](#sass)!

Custom metrics were also used for part of the [Custom properties analysis](#custom-properties). While we can get a lot of information about custom property usage from the stylesheets alone, we cannot build a dependency graph without being able to look at the DOM tree for context, as custom properties are inherited. Looking at the computed style of the DOM nodes also gives us information like what kinds of elements each property is applied to, and which of them are [registered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS/RegisterProperty), information that we also cannot get from the stylesheets.

*Unless otherwise noted, stats presented in this chapter refer to the set of mobile pages.*

## Usage

While JavaScript far surpasses CSS in its share of page weight, CSS has certainly grown in size over the years, with the median desktop page loading 62 KB of CSS code, and 1 in 10 pages loading more than 240 KB of CSS code. Mobile pages do use slightly less CSS code across all percentiles, but only by 4 to 7 KB. While this is definitely greater than previous years, it doesn't come close to [JavaScript’s whopping median of 444 KB and top 10% of 1.2 MB](./javascript/#how-much-javascript-do-we-use)

{{ figure_markup(
  image="stylesheet-size.png",
  caption="Distribution of the stylesheet transfer size per page.",
  description="Bar chart showing the distribution of stylesheet transfer size per page, which includes compression when enabled. Desktop tends to have slightly more stylesheet bytes per page by about 10 KB. The 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90th percentiles for mobile are: 5, 22, 56, 122, and 234 KB.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=762340058&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="314594173",
  sql_file="stylesheet_kbytes.sql"
) }}

It would be reasonable to assume that a lot of this CSS is generated via preprocessors or other build tools, however **only about 15%** included sourcemaps. It is unclear whether this says more about sourcemap adoption, or build tool usage. Of those, the overwhelming majority (45%) came from other CSS files, indicating usage of build processes that operate on CSS files, such as minification, [autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/), and/or [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/). [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) was far more popular than [Less](https://lesscss.org/) (34% of stylesheets with sourcemaps vs 21%), with SCSS being the more popular dialect (33% for .scss vs 1% for .sass).

All these kilobytes of code are typically distributed across multiple files and `<style>` elements; only about 7% of pages concentrate all their CSS code in one remote stylesheet, as we are often taught to do. In fact, the median page contains 3 `<style>` elements and 6 (!) remote stylesheets, with 10% of them carrying over 14 `<style>` elements and over 20 remote CSS files! While this is suboptimal on desktop, it really kills performance on mobile, where round-trip latency is more important than raw download speed.

Shockingly, the maximum number of stylesheets per page is an incredible 26,777 `<style>` elements and 1,379 remote ones! I'd definitely want to avoid loading *that* page!

{{ figure_markup(
  image="stylesheet-count.png",
  caption="Distribution of the number of stylesheets per page.",
  description="Bar chart showing the distribution of stylesheets per page. Desktop and mobile are nearly equal throughout the distribution. The 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90th percentiles for mobile are: 1, 3, 6, 12, and 21 stylesheets per page.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=163217622&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1111507751",
  sql_file="stylesheet_count.sql"
) }}

Another metric of size is the number of rules. The median page carries a total of 448 rules and 5,454 declarations. Interestingly, 10% of pages contain a tiny amount of CSS: fewer than 13 rules! Despite mobile having slightly smaller stylesheets, it also has slightly more rules, indicating smaller rules overall (as it tends to happen with media queries).

## Selectors and the cascade

### Class names

What do developers use class names for these days? To answer this question, we looked at the most popular class names. The list was dominated by Font Awesome classes, with 192 out of 198 being `fa` or `fa-*`! The only thing that initial exploration could tell us was that Font Awesome is exceedingly popular and is used by almost one third of websites!

However, once we collapsed `fa-*` and then `wp-*` classes (which come from WordPress, another exceedingly popular piece of software), we got more meaningful results. Omitting these, state-related classes seem to be most popular, with `.active` occurring in nearly half of websites, and `.selected` and `.disabled` following soon after.

Only a few of the top classes were presentational, with most of those being either alignment related (`pull-right` and `pull-left` from older Bootstrap, `alignright`, `alignleft` etc) or `clearfix`, which still occurs in 22% of websites, despite floats being superseded as a layout method by the more modern Grid and Flexbox modules.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="popular-class-names.png",
  caption="The most popular class names by the percent of pages.",
  description="Bar chart showing the top 14 most popular class names for desktop and mobile pages. The active class is found on 40% of pages. The rest of the classes are found on 20-30% of pages and are, in decreasing order: fa, fa-*, pull-right, pull-left, selected, disabled, clearfix, button, title, wp-*, btn, container, and sr-only.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=1187401149&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="863628849",
  sql_file="top_selector_classes_wp_fa_prefixes.sql"
) }}

### IDs

Despite IDs being discouraged these days in some circles due to their much higher specificity, most websites still use them, albeit sparingly. Fewer than half of pages used more than one ID in any of their selectors (had a max specificity of (1,x,y) or less) and nearly all had a median specificity that did not include IDs (0,x,y).

But what are these IDs used for? It turns out that the most popular IDs are structural: `#content`, `#footer`, `#header`, `#main`, despite [corresponding HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure#HTML_layout_elements_in_more_detail).

{{ figure_markup(
  image="popular-ids.png",
  caption="The most popular IDs by the percent of pages.",
  description="Bar chart showing the top 10 most popular IDs for desktop and mobile pages. The most popular ID is content at 14% of pages. The footer and header IDs have slightly smaller adoption. The logo, main, respond, comments, fancybox-loading, wrapper, and submit IDs have between 5 and 10% adoption on pages. The only notable difference between desktop and mobile is the comments ID used on about 8% of mobile pages but only 5% of desktop pages.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=141873739&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="734822190",
  sql_file="top_selector_ids.sql"
) }}

IDs can also be used to intentionally reduce or increase specificity. The specificity hack of writing an ID selector as an attribute selector (`[id="foo"]` instead of `#foo`) was surprisingly rare, with only 0.3% of pages using it at least once. Another ID-related specificity hack, using a negation + descendant selector like `:not(#nonexistent) .foo` instead of `.foo` to increase specificity, was also very rare, appearing in only 0.1% of pages.

### !important

Instead, the old, crude `!important` is still used a fair bit despite its [well-known drawbacks](https://www.impressivewebs.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-important-css-declaration/#post-475:~:text=Drawbacks,-to). The median page uses `!important` in nearly 2% of its declarations, or 1 in 50. Some developers literally cannot get enough of it: we found 2304 desktop pages and 2138 mobile ones that use `!important` in **every single declaration!**.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="important-properties.png",
  caption="Distribution of the percent of `!important` properties per page.",
  description="Bar chart showing the distribution of the percent of !important properties per page. Desktop pages tend to use !important on slightly more properties than mobile. The 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90th percentiles for mobile are: 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7% of properties having !important.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=768784205&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1743048352",
  sql_file="meta_important_adoption.sql"
) }}

What is it that developers are so keen to override? We looked at breakdown by property, and found that nearly 80% of pages use `!important` with the `display` property. It is a common strategy to apply `display: none !important` to hide content in helper classes to override existing CSS that uses `display` to define a layout mode. This is a side effect of what, in hindsight, was a flaw in CSS. It combined three orthogonal characteristics into one: internal layout mode, flow behavior, and visibility status are all controlled by the `display` property. There are efforts to separate out these values into separate `display` keywords so that they can be tweaked independently via custom properties, but [browser support is virtually nonexistent](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_display_multi-keyword_values) for the time being.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="important-top-properties.png",
  caption="The top `!important` properties by the percent of pages.",
  description="Bar chart showing the top 10 properties used with !important. Mobile and desktop have similar usage. The display property is used with !important the most, by 79% of mobile pages. In decreasing order, the subsequent properties on 71-58% of mobile pages are: color, width, height, background, padding, margin, border, background-color, and float.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=257343566&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1222608982",
  sql_file="meta_important_properties.sql"
) }}

### Specificity and classes

Besides keeping ids and `!important`s few and far between, there is a trend to circumvent specificity altogether by cramming all the selection criteria of a selector in a single class name, thus forcing all rules to have the same specificity and turning the cascade into a simpler last-one-wins system. BEM is a popular methodology of that type, albeit not the only one. While it is difficult to assess how many websites use BEM-style methodologies exclusively, since following it in every rule is rare (even the [BEM website](https://en.bem.info/) uses multiple classes in many selectors), about 10% of pages had a median specificity of (0,1,0), which may indicate mostly following a BEM-style methodology. On the opposite end of BEM, often developers use [duplicated classes](https://csswizardry.com/2014/07/hacks-for-dealing-with-specificity/#safely-increasing-specificity) to *increase* specificity and nudge a selector ahead of another one (e.g. `.foo.foo` instead of `.foo`). This kind of specificity hack is actually more popular than BEM, being present in 14% of mobile websites (9% of desktop)! This may indicate that most developers do not actually want to get rid of the cascade altogether, they just need more control over it.

### Attribute selectors

The most popular attribute selector, by far, is on the `type` attribute, used in 45% of pages, likely to style inputs of different types, e.g. to style textual inputs differently from radios, checkboxes, sliders, file upload controls etc.

  image="attribute-selectors.png",

  description="Bar chart showing the top attribute selectors by the percent of pages. Mobile and desktop have similar usage.

The following attribute selectors are used on between 17 and 3% in descending order: disabled, dir, title, hidden, controls, data-type, data-align, href, poster, role, style, xmlns, aria-disabled, src, id, name, lang, and multiple.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=320159317&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1926527049",
  sql_file="top_selector_attributes.sql"
) }}

### Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

There is always a lot of inertia when we change something in the Web platform after it's long established. As an example, the Web has still largely not caught up with pseudo-elements having separate syntax compared to pseudo-classes, even though this was a change that happened over a decade ago. All pseudo-elements that are also available with a pseudo-class syntax for legacy reasons are **vastly** more widespread (2.5x to 5x!) with the pseudo-class syntax.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="selector-pseudo-classes.png",
  caption="Usage of legacy `:pseudo-class` syntax for `::pseudo-elements` as a percent of mobile pages.",
  description="Bar chart showing the percent of pages that use pseudo-class syntax (prefixed by one colon) versus pseudo-element syntax (two colons) for pseudo-elements. The before pseudo-element is used with pseudo-class syntax on 71% of mobile pages and pseudo-element syntax on 33% of mobile pages. The after pseudo-element is used with class and element syntax on 68% and 30% of mobile pages, first-letter on 7% and 1% of mobile pages, and first-line on 1% and 0% of mobile pages.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=227968207&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="2029589646",
  sql_file="top_selector_pseudo_classes.sql"
) }}

By far the most popular pseudo-classes are user action ones, with `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:active` at the top of the list, all used in over two thirds of pages, indicating that developers like the convenience of specifying declarative UI interactions.

`:root` seems far more popular than is justified by its function, used in one third of pages. In HTML content, it just selects the `<html>` element, so why didn't developers just use `html`? A possible answer may lie in a common practice related to defining custom properties, [which are also highly used](#custom-properties), on the `:root` pseudo-class. Another answer may lie in specificity: `:root`, being a pseudo-class, has a higher specificity than `html`: (0, 1, 0) vs (0, 0, 1). It is a common hack to increase specificity of a selector by prepending it with `:root`, e.g. `:root .foo` has a specificity of (0, 2, 0) compared to just (0, 1, 0) for `.foo`. This is often all that is needed to nudge a selector slightly over another one in the cascade race and avoid the sledgehammer that is `!important`. To test this hypothesis, we also measured exactly that: how many pages use `:root` at the start of a descendant selector? The results verified our hypothesis: a remarkable 29% of pages use `:root` that way! Furthermore, 14% of desktop pages and 19% of mobile pages use `html` at the start of a descendant selector, possibly to give the selector an even smaller specificity boost. The popularity of these specificity hacks strongly indicates that developers need more fine grained control to tweak specificity than what is afforded to them via `!important`. Thankfully, this is coming soon with [`:where()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where), which is already [implemented across the board](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_where) (albeit behind a flag in Chrome for now).

  caption="The most popular pseudo-classes as a percent of pages.",
  description="Bar chart showing the most popular pseudo-classes as a percent of pages for desktop and mobile. Desktop and mobile are mostly similar, with mobile tending to have slightly higher adoption. The most popular pseudo-class is hover, used on 84% of pages. The following pseudo-classes decrease in popularity from 71% to 12% almost linearly: before, after, focus, active, first-child, last-child, visited, not, root, nth-child, link, disabled, empty, nth-of-type.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=1363774711&format=interactive",

  sql_file="top_selector_pseudo_classes.sql"
) }}

When it comes to pseudo-elements, after the usual suspects `::before` and `::after`, nearly all popular pseudo-elements were browser extensions for styling form controls and other built-in UI, strongly echoing the developer need for more fine-grained control over styling of built in UI. Styling of focus rings, placeholders, search inputs, spinners, selection, scrollbars, media controls was especially popular.

The humble `px` unit has gotten a lot of negative press over the years. At first, because it didn't play nicely with old IE's zoom functionality, and, more recently, because there are better units for most tasks that scale based on another design factor, such as viewport size, element font size, or root font size, reducing maintenance effort by making implicit design relationships explicit. The main selling point of `px` — its correspondence to one device pixel giving designers full control — is also gone now, as a pixel is not a device pixel anymore with the modern high pixel density screens. Despite all this, CSS pixels still nearly ubiquitously drive the Web's designs.

) }}

The `px` unit is still going strong as the most popular length unit overall, with a whopping **72.58% of all length values across all stylesheets using `px`**! And if we exclude percentages (since they are not really a unit) the share of `px` increases even more, to 84.14%.

The px unit is by far the most popular, used 73% of the time in mobile stylesheets. The next most popular unit is % (percent sign), at 17%, followed by em at 9%, and rem at 1%. The following units all have usage so low that they round to 0%: pt, vw, vh, ch, ex, cm, mm, in, vmin, pc, and vmax.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=2095127496&format=interactive",

How are these `px` distributed across properties? Is there any difference depending on the property? Most definitely. For example, as one might expect, `px` is far more popular in borders (80-90%) compared to font-related metrics such as `font-size`, `line-height` or `text-indent`. However, even for those, `px` usage vastly outnumbers any other unit. In fact, the **only** properties for which another unit (*any* other unit) is more used than `px` are `vertical-align` (55% `em`), `mask-position` (50% `em`), `padding-inline-start` (62% `em`), `margin-block-start` and `margin-block-end` (65% `em`), and the brand new `gap` with 62% `rem`.

One could easily argue that a lot of this content is just old, written before authors were more enlightened about using relative units to make their designs more adaptable and save themselves time down the line. However, this is easily debunked by looking at more recent properties such as `grid-gap` (62% `px`).

Similarly, despite the much touted advantages of `rem` vs `em` for many use cases, and its universal browser support [for years](https://caniuse.com/rem), the Web has still largely not caught up with it: the trusty `em` accounts for 87% of all font-relative units usage and `rem` trails far behind with 12%. We did see some usage of `ch` (width of the '0' glyph) and `ex` (x-height of the font in use) in the wild, but very small (only 0.37% and 0.19% of all font-relative units).

{{ figure_markup(

Lengths are the only types of CSS values for which we can omit the unit when the value is zero, i.e. we can write `0` instead of `0px` or `0em` etc. Developers (or CSS minifiers?) are taking advantage of this extensively: Out of all `0` values, 89% were unitless.

### Calculations

When the [`calc()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc()) function was introduced for performing calculations between different units in CSS, it was a revolution. Previously, only preprocessors were able to accommodate such calculations, but the results were limited to static values and unreliable, since they were missing the dynamic context that is often necessary.

Today, `calc()` has been [supported by every browser](https://caniuse.com/calc) for nine years already, so it comes as no surprise that it has been widely adopted with 60% of pages using it at least once. If anything, we expected even higher adoption than this.

`calc()` is primarily used for lengths, with 96% of its usage being concentrated in properties that accept `<length>` values, and 60% of that (58% of total usage) on the `width` property!

{{ figure_markup(
  image="calc-properties.png",
  caption="Relative popularity of properties that use `calc()` as a percent of occurrences.",
  description="Bar chart showing the relative popularity of properties that use the calc function as a percent of occurrences. Desktop and mobile have similar results. The calc function is used most often on the width property, 59% of calc occurrences on mobile pages. It's used on the left property 11% of the time, top 5%, max-width 4%, height 4%, and the remaining properties are decreasing at 2% and 1%: min-height, margin-left, flex-basis, margin-right, max-height (1%), right, padding-bottom, padding-left, font-size, and padding-right.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=722318406&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1661677319",
  sql_file="calc_properties.sql"
) }}

It appears that most of this usage is to subtract pixels from percentages, as evidenced by the fact that the most common units in `calc()` are `px` (51% of `calc()` usage) and `%` (42% of `calc()` usage), and that 64% of `calc()` usage involves subtraction. Interestingly, the most popular length units with `calc()` are different than the most popular length units overall (e.g. `rem` is more popular than `em`, followed by viewport units), most likely due to the fact that code using `calc()` is newer.

Most calculations are very simple, with 99.5% of calculations involving up to 2 different units, 88.5% of calculations involving up to 2 operators and 99.4% of calculations involving one set of parentheses or fewer (3 out of 4 calculations include no parentheses at all).

### Global keywords and `all`

For a long time, CSS only supported one global keyword: [`inherit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit), which enables the resetting of an inheritable property to its inherited value or reusing the parent’s value for a given non-inheritable property. It turns out the former is far more common than the latter, with 81.37% of `inherit` usage being found on inheritable properties. The rest is mostly to inherit backgrounds, borders, or dimensions. The latter likely indicates layout struggles, as with the proper layout mode one rarely needs to force `width` and `height` to inherit.

The `inherit` keyword has been particularly useful for resetting the gory default link colors to the parent’s text color, when we intend to use something other than color as an affordance for links. It is therefore no surprise that `color` is the most common property that `inherit` is used on. Nearly one third of all `inherit` usage is found on the `color` property. 75% of pages use `color: inherit` at least once.

While a property’s *initial value* is a concept that [has existed since CSS 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/#cascading-order), it only got its own dedicated keyword, `initial`, to explicitly refer to it [17 years later](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-css3-cascade-20130103/#initial-keyword), and it took another two years for said keyword to gain [universal browser support](https://caniuse.com/css-initial-value) in 2015. It is therefore no surprise that it is used far less than `inherit`. While the ol’ inherit is found on 85% of pages, `initial` appears in 51% of them. Furthermore, there is a lot of confusion about what `initial` actually does, since `display` tops the list of properties most commonly used with `initial`, with `display: initial` appearing in 10% of pages. Presumably, the developers thought that this resets `display` to its value from the [user agent stylesheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade#User-agent_stylesheets) value and were using it to toggle `display: none` on and off. However, [the initial value of `display` is `inline`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display/#the-display-properties), so `display: initial` is just another way to write `display: inline` and has no context-dependent magical properties.

Instead, `display: revert` would have actually done what these developers likely expected and would have reset `display` to the UA value for the given element. However, `revert` is much newer: it was defined [in 2015](https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-css-cascade-4-20150908/#valdef-all-revert) and  [only gained universal browser support this year](https://caniuse.com/css-revert-value), which explains its underuse: it only appears in 0.14% of pages and half of its usage is `line-height: revert;`, found in [recent versions of Wordpress’ TwentyTwenty theme](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/303180b392c530b8e2c8b3c27532d591b915caeb).

The last global keyword, `unset` is essentially a hybrid of `initial` and `inherit`. On inherited properties it becomes `inherit` and on the rest it becomes `initial`, essentially resetting the property across all cascade origins. Similarly, to `initial`, it was [defined in 2013](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-css-cascade-3-20130730/#inherit-initial) and gained [full browser support in 2015](https://caniuse.com/css-unset-value). Despite `unset`’s higher utility, it is used in only 43% of pages, whereas `initial` is used in 51% of pages. Furthermore, besides `max-width` and `min-width`, in every other property `initial` usage outweighs `unset` usage.

  image="keyword-totals.png",
  caption="Adoption of global keywords as a percent of pages.",
  description="Bar chart showing the adoption of global keywords as a percent of pages. Mobile pages tend to have a higher adoption rate. The inherit keyword is used on 85% of mobile pages, initial on 51%, unset on 43%, and revert on approximately 0%.",

  sheets_gid="437371205",
  sql_file="keyword_totals.sql"
) }}

The `all` property was [introduced in 2013](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/WD-css3-cascade-20130103/#all-shorthand) and gained [near-universal support in 2016 (except Edge) and universal support earlier this year](https://caniuse.com/css-all). It is a shorthand of nearly every property in CSS (except custom properties, `direction`, and `unicode-bidi`), and only accepts the four global keywords as values. It was envisioned as a one liner CSS reset, either as `all: unset` or `all: revert`, depending on what kind of reset we wanted. However, adoption is still very low: we only found `all` on 477 pages (0.01% of all pages), and only used with the `revert` keyword.

## Color

They say the old jokes are the best, and that goes for colors too. The original, cryptic, `#rrggbb` hex syntax remains the most popular way to specify a color in CSS in 2020: Half of all colors are written that way. The next most popular format is the somewhat shorter `#rgb` three-digit hex format at 26%. While it is shorter, it is also able to express *way* fewer colors; only 4096, out of the 16.7 million sRGB values.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="popular-color-formats.png",
  caption="Relative popularity of color formats as a percent of occurrences.",
  description="Bar chart showing the relative popularity of color formats as a percent of occurrences. The #rrggbb color format is used in 50% of occurrences on mobile pages, with desktop slightly higher at 52%. The #rgb format is used in 25% of occurrences, followed by rgba() at 14%, transparent at 8%, a named color (like red) at 1%, and the remaining color formats all have approximately 0% relative popularity on mobile pages: #rrggbbaa, rbg(), hsla(), currentColor, #rgba, a system color, hsl(), and color().",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=65722098&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="366025718",
  sql_file="color_formats.sql"
) }}

Similarly, 99.89% of functionally specified sRGB colors are using the since-forever legacy format with commas `rgb(127, 255, 84)` rather than the new comma-less form `rgb(127 255 84)`. Because, despite all modern browsers accepting the new syntax, changing offers zero advantage to developers.

So why do people stray from these tried and true formats? To express alpha transparency. This is clear when you look at `rgba()`, which is used 40 times more than `rgb()` (13.82% vs 0.34% of all colors) and `hsla()`, which is used 30 times more than `hsl()` (0.25% vs 0.01% of all colors).

And yes, these numbers also show that despite the much-vaunted (but [largely incorrect](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-4/#the-hsl-notation)) *easily-understood* or *easily-modified advantages* of HSL, in practice it is used *far less* than RGB.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="color-formats-alpha.png",
  caption="Relative popularity of color formats grouped by alpha support as a percent of occurrences on mobile pages (excluding `#rrggbb` and `#rgb`).",
  description="Bar chart showing the relative popularity of color formats grouped by alpha support as a percent of occurrences on mobile pages, excluding #rrggbb and #rgb. Color formats that support alpha add up to about 23% of occurrences, while color formats that do not support alpha add up to only 2% of occurrences on mobile pages.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=1861989753&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="366025718",
  sql_file="color_formats.sql"
) }}

What about named colors? The keyword `transparent`, which is just another way to say `rgb(0 0 0 / 0)`, is most popular, at 8.25% of all sRGB values (66% of all named-color usage); followed by  all the named (X11) colors – I’m looking at you, `papayawhip` – at 1.48%. The most popular of these were the easily understood names like `white`, `black`, `red`, `gray`, `blue`. `Whitesmoke` was the most common  of the non-ordinary names (sure, we can visualize whitesmoke, right) while the likes of `gainsboro`, `lightCoral` and `burlywood` were used way less. We can understand why, you need to look them up to see what they actually mean.

And if you are going for fanciful color names, why not define your own with CSS [Custom properties](#custom-properties)? `--intensePurple` and `--corporateBlue` mean whatever you need them to mean. This probably explains why [50% of Custom Properties](#usage-by-type) are used for colors.

And, lastly, the once-deprecated, now partially un-deprecated system colors like `Canvas` and `ThreeDDarkShadow`: These were a terrible idea, introduced to emulate the typical user interface of things like Java or Windows 95, and already unable to keep up with Windows 98, they soon fell by the wayside. Some sites use these system colors to try and fingerprint you, a loophole that [we are trying to close as we speak](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5710). There are *few good reasons* to use them, and most websites (99.99%) don’t, so we are all good.

The rather useful value `currentColor`, surprisingly, trailed at 0.14% of all sRGB colors (1.62% of all named colors).

All the colors we discussed so far have one thing in common: sRGB, the standard color space for the Web (and for High Definition TV, which is where it came from). Why is that so bad? Because it can only display a limited range of colors: your phone, your TV, and probably your laptop are able to display much more vivid colors due to advances in display technology. Displays with wide color gamut, which used to be reserved for well-paid professional photographers and graphic designers, are now available to everyone. Native apps use this capability, as do digital movies and streaming TV services, but until recently the Web was missing out.

And we are still missing out. Despite being [implemented in Safari in 2016](https://webkit.org/blog/6682/improving-color-on-the-web/), the use of display-p3 color in Web pages is vanishingly small. Our crawl of the Web found only 29 mobile and 36 desktop pages (!) using it. (And more than half of those were syntax errors, mistakes, or attempts to use the never-implemented `color-mod()` function). We were curious why.

Compatibility, right? You don’t want things to break? No. In the stylesheets we examined, we found solid use of fallback: with document order, the cascade, `@supports`, the `color-gamut` media query, all that good stuff. So in a style sheet we would see the color the designer wanted, expressed in display-p3, and also a fallback sRGB color. We computed the visible difference (a calculation called [ΔE2000](https://zschuessler.github.io/DeltaE/learn/)) between the desired and fallback color and this was typically quite modest. A small tweak. A careful exploration. In fact, 37.6% of the time, the color specified in display-p3 actually fell inside the range of colors (the gamut) that sRGB can manage.

The purplish colors are similar in sRGB and display-p3, perhaps because both those color spaces have the same blue primary. Various reds, orange-yellows, and greens are near the sRGB gamut boundary (nearly as saturated as possible) and map to analogous points near the display-p3 gamut boundary.

There seem to be two reasons why the Web is still trapped in sRGB land. The first is lack of tools, lack of good color pickers, lack of understanding of what more vivid colors are available. But the major reason, we think, is that to date Safari is the only browser to implement it. This is changing, rapidly - Chrome and Firefox are both implementing right now - but until that support ships, probably using display-p3  is too much effort for too little gain because [only 17% of viewers](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) will see those colors. Most people will see the fallback. So current usage is a subtle shift in color vibrancy, rather than a big difference.

It will be interesting to see how the use of display-p3 color (other options exist, but this is the only one we found in the wild) changes over the next year or two.

Because *wide color gamut* (WCG) is only the beginning. The TV and movie industry has already moved past P3 to an even wider gamut, rec2020; and also a wider range of lightness, from blinding reflections to deepest shadows. *High Dynamic Range* (HDR) has already arrived in the home, especially on games, streaming TV and movies. The Web has a bunch of catching up to do.

## Gradients

Despite minimalism and flat design being all the rage, CSS gradients are used in 75% of pages. As expected, nearly all gradients are used in backgrounds. 74.45% of pages specify gradients in backgrounds, but only 7% in **any** other property.

Linear gradients are 5 times more popular than radial ones, appearing in almost 73% of pages, compared to 15% for radial gradients. The difference in popularity is so staggering, that even `-ms-linear-gradient()`, which **was never needed** (IE10 supported gradients both with and without the `-ms-` prefix), is more popular than `radial-gradient()`! The [newly supported](https://caniuse.com/css-conic-gradients) `conic-gradient()` is even more underutilized, appearing in only 652 desktop pages (0.01%) and 848 mobile pages (0.01%), which is expected, since Firefox has only just shipped its implementation to the stable channel.

Repeating gradients of all types are fairly underused too, with `repeating-linear-gradient()` appearing in only 3% of pages and the others trailing behind even more (`repeating-conic-gradient()` is only used in 21 pages!).

Prefixed gradients are also still very common, even though prefixes haven't been needed in gradients since 2013.  It is notable that -webkit-gradient() is still used in half of all websites, even though it [hasn't been needed since 2011](https://caniuse.com/css-gradients). And  `-webkit-linear-gradient()` is still the second most used gradient function of all, appearing in 57% of websites, with the other prefixed forms also being used in a third to half of pages.

Using color stops with different colors in the same position (hard stops) to create stripes and other patterns is a technique [first popularized in 2010](https://lea.verou.me/2010/12/checkered-stripes-other-background-patterns-with-css3-gradients/) (by Lea Verou), which by now has many interesting variations, including [some really cool ones with blend modes](https://bennettfeely.com/gradients/). While it may seem like a hack, hard stops are found in 50% of pages, indicating a strong developer need for lightweight graphics from within CSS without resorting to image editors or external SVG.

 Interpolation hints (or as Adobe, who popularized the technique, calls them: “midpoints”) are found on 22% of pages, despite [near universal browser support since 2015](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_image_gradient_linear-gradient_interpolation_hints). Which is a shame, because without them, the color stops are connected by straight-lines in the colorspace, rather than smooth curves. This low usage probably reflects a misunderstanding of what they do, or how to use them; contrast this with CSS transitions and animations, where easing functions (which do much the same thing, i.e. connect the keyframes with curves rather than jerky straight lines) are much more commonly used ([80% of transitions](#transitions-and-animations)). “Midpoints” is not a very understandable description, and “interpolation hint” sounds like you are helping the browser to do simple arithmetic.

Most gradient usage is rather simple, with over 75% of gradients found across the entire dataset only using 2 color stops. In fact, fewer than half of pages contain even a single gradient with more than 3 color stops!

The gradient with the most color stops is [this one](https://dabblet.com/gist/4d1637d78c71ef2d8d37952fc6e90ff5) with 646 stops! So pretty! This is almost certainly generated, and the resulting CSS code is 8KB, so a 1px tall PNG would likely have done the job as well, with a smaller footprint.

## Layout

### Flexbox and Grid adoption

In the [2019 edition](../2019/css#flexbox), 41% of pages across mobile and desktop were reported as containing [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) properties. In 2020, this number has grown to 63% for mobile and 65% for desktop. With the number of legacy sites developed before Flexbox was a viable tool still in existence, we can safely say there is wide adoption of this layout method.

If we look at [Grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), the percentage of sites using Grid layout has grown to 4% for mobile and 5% for desktop. Usage has doubled since last year, but still lags behind flex layout.

Note that unlike most other metrics in this chapter this is actual measured Grid usage, and not just grid-related properties and values that are specified in a stylesheet and potentially not used. While at first glance this may seem more accurate, one thing to keep in mind is that HTTP Archive crawls homepages, so this data may be skewed lower due to grids often appearing more in internal pages. So, let's look at another metric as well: how many pages specify `display: grid` and `display: flex` in their stylesheets? That metric puts Grid layout at significantly higher adoption, with 30% of pages using `display: grid` at least once. It does not however affect the number for Flexbox as significantly, with 68% of pages specifying `display: flex`. While this sounds like impressively high adoption for Flexbox, it's worth noting that CSS tables are still far more popular with 80% of pages using table display modes! Some of this usage may be due to [certain types of clearfix](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/clear-fix/) which use `display: table`, and not for actual layout.

Given that Flexbox was usable in browsers earlier than Grid layout, it is likely that some of the Flexbox usage is for setting up  a grid system. In order to use Flexbox as a grid, authors need to disable some of the inherent flexibility of Flexbox. To do this you set the `flex-grow` property to `0`, then size flex items using percentages. Using this information we were able to report that 19% of sites both on desktop and mobile were using Flexbox in this grid-like way.

The reasons for choosing Flexbox over grid are frequently cited as browser support, given that Grid layout was [not supported in Internet Explorer](https://caniuse.com/css-grid). In addition, some authors may well not have learned Grid layout yet or are using a framework with a Flexbox-based grid system. The [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/) framework currently uses a Flexbox-based grid, in common with several other popular framework choices.

### Usage of different Grid layout techniques

The Grid layout specification gives a number of ways to describe and define layout in CSS. The most basic usage involves laying items out [from one grid line to another](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/understanding-css-grid-lines/). What about [naming lines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Layout_using_Named_Grid_Lines), or use of grid-template-areas?

For named lines, we checked for the presence of square brackets in a track listing. The name or names being placed inside square brackets.

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: [main-start] 1fr [content-start] 1fr [content-end] 1fr [main-end];
}
```

The result of this showed that 0.23% of grid-using pages on mobile had named lines, and 0.27% on desktop.

The [grid-template-areas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Grid_Template_Areas) feature, allowing authors to name grid items then place them on the grid as the value of the grid-template-areas property, fared a little better. Of grid-using sites, 19% on mobile and 20% on desktop were using this method.

These results show that not only is Grid layout usage still relatively low on production websites, the usage of it is relatively straightforward. Authors are choosing to use the simple line-based placement over methods which would allow them to name lines and areas. While there is nothing wrong in choosing to do so, I wonder if slow adoption of Grid layout is partly due to the fact that authors haven’t yet realized the power of these features. If Grid layout is seen as essentially Flexbox with poor browser support, this would certainly make it a less compelling choice.

### Multiple-column layout

The [multiple-column layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns/Basic_Concepts_of_Multicol) specification enables laying out of content in columns, much as in a newspaper. While popular in CSS as used for print, it is less useful on the web due to the risk of creating a situation where a reader needs to scroll up and down to read the content. Based on the data, however, there are significantly more pages using multicol than Grid layout with 15.33% on the desktop and 14.95% on mobile. While basic multicol properties are well supported, more complex usage and controlling column breaks with [fragmentation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/css-fragmentation/) has [patchy support](https://caniuse.com/multicolumn). Considering this, it was quite surprising to see how much usage there is.

### Box sizing

It is useful to know how big the boxes on your page are going to be, but with the [standard CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#What_is_the_CSS_box_model) adding padding and border onto the size of the content-box, the size you gave your box is smaller than the box rendered on your page. While we can’t change history, the box-sizing property allows authors to switch to applying the specified size to the border-box, so the size you set is the size you see rendered. How many sites are using the box-sizing property? Most of them! The box-sizing property appears in 83.79% of desktop CSS and 86.39% on mobile.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="box-sizing.png",
  caption="Distribution of the number of `border-box` declarations per page.",
  description="Bar chart showing the distribution of the number of box-sizing declarations per page for desktop and mobile. The mobile distribution leads desktop by 0 to 11 declarations per page, growing in the higher percentiles. The mobile distribution's 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90th percentiles are: 0, 4, 17, 46, and 96 border-box declarations per page.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=1626960751&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1982524793",
  sql_file="box_sizing.sql"
) }}

The median desktop page has 14 box-sizing declarations. Mobile has 17. Perhaps due to component systems inserting the declaration per component, rather than globally as a rule for all elements in the stylesheet.

## Transitions and animations

Transitions and animations have overall become very popular with the `transition` property being used on 81% of all pages and `animation` on 73% of mobile pages and 70% of desktop pages. It is somewhat surprising that usage is not lower on mobile, where one would expect that [conserving battery power](https://css-tricks.com/how-web-content-can-affect-power-usage/) would be a priority. On the other hand, CSS animations are *far* more battery efficient than JS animation, especially the majority of them that just animate transforms and opacity (see next section).

The single most common transition property specified is `all`, used in 41% of pages. This is a little baffling because `all` is the initial value, so it does not actually need to be explicitly specified. After that, fade in/out transitions appear to be the most common type, used in over one third of crawled pages, followed by transitions on the `transform` property (most likely spin, scale, movement transitions). Surprisingly, transitioning `height` is much more popular than transitioning `max-height`, even though the latter is a commonly taught workaround when the start or end height is unknown (auto). It was also surprising to see significant usage for the `scale` property (2%), despite its lack of support beyond Firefox. Intentional usage of cutting edge CSS, a typo, or a misunderstanding of how to animate transforms?

We were glad to discover that most of these transitions are fairly short, with the median transition duration being only 300ms, and 90% of websites having median durations of less than half a second. This is generally good practice, as longer transitions can make a UI feel sluggish, while a short transition communicates a change without getting in the way.

The specification authors got it right! `Ease` is the most popular timing function specified, even though it's the default so it can actually be omitted. Perhaps people explicitly specify the defaults because they prefer the self documenting verbosity, or — perhaps more likely — because they don't know that they are defaults. Despite the drawbacks of linearly progressing animation (it tends to look dull and unnatural), `linear` is the second most highly used timing function with 19.1%. It is also interesting that the built-in easing functions accommodate over 87% of all transitions: only 12.7% chose to specify a custom easing via `cubic-bezier()`.

A major driver of animation adoption seems to be Font Awesome, as evidenced by the animation name `fa-spin` appearing in 1 out of 4 pages and thus topping the list of most popular animation names. While there are a wide variety of animation names, it appears that most of them fall into only a few basic categories, with 1 in 5 animations being some kind of spin. That may also explain the high percentage of linearly progressing transitions & animations: if we want a smooth perpetual rotation, `linear` is the way to go.

  image="transition-animation-names.png",

## Visual effects

### Blend modes

Last year, 8% of pages were using blend modes. This year, adoption has increased significantly, with 13% of pages using blend modes on elements (`mix-blend-mode`), and 2% in backgrounds (`background-blend-mode`).

### Filters

Adoption of filters has remained high, with the `filter` property making an appearance in 79.43% of pages. While at first this was quite exciting, a lot of it is likely to be old [IE DX filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Web/CSS/-ms-filter), which shared the same property name. When we only took into account valid CSS filters that Blink recognizes, usage drops to 22% for mobile and 20% for desktop, with `blur()` being the most popular filter type, appearing in 4% of pages.

Another filter property, `backdrop-filter`, allows us to apply filters to only the area *behind* an element, which is incredibly useful for improving contrast on translucent backgrounds, and creating the elegant ["frosted glass" effect](https://css-tricks.com/backdrop-filter-effect-with-css/) we've come to know from many native UIs. While not nearly as popular as `filter`, we found `backdrop-filter` in 6% of pages.

The `filter()` function allows us to apply a filter only on a particular image, which can be extremely useful for backgrounds. Sadly, it is [currently only supported by Safari](https://caniuse.com/css-filter-function). We did not find any usage of `filter()`.

### Masks

A decade ago, we got masks in Safari with `-webkit-mask-image` and it was exciting. Everyone and their dog were using them. We eventually got [a spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-masking-1/) and a set of unprefixed properties closely modeled after the WebKit prototype, and it seemed a matter of time until masking became standard, with a consistent syntax across all browsers. Fast forward 10 years later, and the unprefixed syntax is [still not supported in Chrome or Safari, meaning its available on less than 5% of users' browsers worldwide](https://caniuse.com/css-masks). It is therefore no surprise that `-webkit-mask-image` is still more popular than its standard counterpart, being found in 22% of pages. However, despite its very poor support, `mask-image` is found on 19% of pages. We see a similar pattern across most other masking properties with the unprefixed versions appearing in almost as many pages as the `-webkit-` ones. Overall, despite them falling out of hype, masks are still found in nearly a quarter of the Web, indicating that the use cases are still there, despite lack of implementer interest (hint, hint!).

  sheets_gid="1513860089",
  sql_file="all_properties.sql"
) }}

### Clipping paths

Around the same time masks got popular, another similar but simpler property (originally from SVG) started making the rounds: `clip-path`. However, unlike masks, it had a brighter fate. It got standardized fairly quickly, and got support across the board relatively fast, with the last holdout being Safari which dropped the prefix in 2016. Today, it is found on 19% of pages unprefixed and 13% with the `-webkit-` prefix.

## Responsive design

Making sites that cope with the many different screen sizes and devices that browse the web has become somewhat easier with the built-in flexible and responsive new layout methods such as Flexbox and Grid. These layout methods are usually further enhanced with the use of media queries. The data shows that 80% of desktop sites and 83% of mobile sites use media queries that are associated with responsive design, such as `min-width`.

### Which media features are people using?

As you might expect, the most common media features in use are the viewport size features which have been in use since the early days of responsive web design. The percentage of sites checking for `max-width` is 78% for both desktop and mobile. A check for `min-width` features on 75% of mobile and 73% of desktop sites.

The `orientation` media feature, which allows authors to differentiate their layout based on whether the screen is portrait or landscape, can be found on 33% of all sites.

We are seeing some newer media features come up in the statistics. The [`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://web.dev/prefers-reduced-motion/) media feature provides a way to check if the user has requested reduced motion, so that websites can adjust the amount of animation they use. This can be turned on either explicitly, through a user-controlled operating system setting, or implicitly, for example due to decreasing battery level. 24% of sites are checking for this feature.

In other good news, newer features from the [Media Queries Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediaqueries-4/) specification are starting to appear. On mobile 5% of sites are checking for the type of pointer the user has. A `coarse` pointer indicates they are using a touchscreen, whereas a `fine` pointer indicates a pointing device. Understanding the way a user is interacting with your site is often just as helpful, if not more helpful, than looking at screen size. A person might be using a small screen device with a keyboard and mouse, or a high resolution large screen device with a touchscreen and benefit from larger hit areas.

### Common breakpoints

The most common breakpoint in use across desktop and mobile devices is a `min-width` of 768px. 54% of sites use this breakpoint, closely followed by a `max-width` of 767px at 50%. [The Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/) uses a `min-width` of 768px as its “Medium” size, so this may be the source of much of the usage. The other two high-ranking `min-width` values of 1200px (40%) and 992px (37%) are also found in Bootstrap.

  sql_file="media_query_values.sql"

Pixels are very much the unit that is used for breakpoints. There are a few instances of ems a long way down the list, however setting breakpoints in pixels appears to be the popular choice. There are probably many reasons for this. Legacy. All of the early articles on responsive design use pixels, and many people still think about targeting particular devices when creating responsive designs. Sizing [using ems](https://zellwk.com/blog/media-query-units/) involves considering the size of the content rather than the device, and this is a newer way of thinking about web design, perhaps one yet to fully be taken advantage of along with intrinsic sizing methods for layout.

### Properties used inside media queries

On mobile devices 79% and on desktop 77% of media queries are used to change the `display` property. Perhaps indicating that people are testing before switching to a flex or grid formatting context. Again, this may be linked frameworks, for example the [Bootstrap responsive utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/display/).
78% of authors change the `width` property inside media queries, `margin`, `padding` and `font-size` all rank highly for changed properties.

## Custom properties

Last year, only 5% of websites were using custom properties. This year, adoption has skyrocketed. Using last year's query (which only counted declarations that *set* custom properties), usage has quadrupled on mobile (19.29%) and tripled on desktop (14.47%). However, when we look at *values that reference custom properties* via `var()`, we get an even better picture: 27% of mobile pages and 22% of desktop pages were using the `var()` function at least once, which indicates there is a sizeable number of pages only using `var()` to offer customization hooks, without ever setting a custom property.

While at first glance this is impressive adoption, it appears that a major driver is WordPress, as evidenced by the most popular custom property names, the top 4 of which ship with WordPress.

### Naming

{{ figure_markup(
  image="custom-property-names.png",
  caption="Relative popularity of custom property names per software entity as a percent of occurrences on mobile pages.",
  description="Pie chart of the relative popularity of custom property names per software entity responsible for creating those properties, as a percent of occurrences on mobile pages. 35% of occurrences of custom property names on mobile pages can be traced back to Avada, 31% to Bootstrap, 16% to Elementor, 13% to WordPress, and 3% to an old version of Multirange.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=1627287194&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1043074687",
  sql_file="custom_property_names.sql"
) }}

Out of the 1,000 top property names, fewer than 13 are ‘custom’, as in made up by individual web developers.The vast majority are associated with popular software, such as WordPress, Elementor, and Avada. To determine this, we took into account not only which custom properties appear in what software (by searching on GitHub), but also which properties appear in groups with similar frequencies. This does not necessarily mean that the main way a custom property ends up on a website is through usage of that software (people do still copy and paste!), but it does indicate there aren't many organic commonalities between the custom properties that developers define. The only custom property names that seem to have organically made the list of top 1000 are `--height`, `--primary-color`, and `--caption-color`.

### Usage by type

The biggest usage of custom properties appears to be naming colors and keeping colors consistent throughout. Approximately 1 in 5 desktop pages and 1 in 6 mobile pages uses custom properties in `background-color`, and the top 11 properties that contain `var()` references are either color properties or shorthands that contain colors. Lengths is the second biggest usage, with `width` and `height` being used with `var()` in 7% of mobile pages (interestingly, only around 3% of desktop pages). This is also confirmed by the types of most popular values, with color values accounting for 52% of all custom property declarations. Dimensions (= a number + a unit, e.g. lengths, angles, times etc) were the second more popular type, higher than unitless numbers (12%), despite guidance to prefer the latter, since numbers can be converted to dimensions via `calc()` and multiplication, but dimensions cannot be converted to numbers as dividing with dimensions is not supported yet.

The remaining properties use custom properties from 9% to 6% in descending order: border, background, border-top, border-bottom, background-image, box-shadow, height, width, border-left, min-height, margin-top, border-right, and border-left-color. Desktop adoption is about 4 percentage points smaller.",

In preprocessors, color variables are often manipulated to generate color variations, such as different tints. However, in CSS [color modification functions](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/) are merely an unimplemented draft. Right now, the only way to generate new colors from variables is to use variables for individual components and plug them into color functions, such as `rgba()` and `hsla()`. However, fewer than 4% of mobile pages and 0.6% of desktop pages do that, indicating that the high usage of color variables is primarily to hold entire colors, with variations thereof being separate variables instead of dynamically generated.

### Complexity

Next, we looked at how complex custom property usage is. One way to assess code complexity in software engineering is the shape of the dependency graph. We first looked at the *depth* of each custom property. A custom property set to a literal value like e.g. `#fff` has a depth of 0, whereas a property referencing that via var() would have a depth of 1 and so on. For example:

```css
:root {
  --base-hue: 335; /* depth = 0 */
  --base-color: hsl(var(--base-hue) 90% 50%); /* depth = 1 */
  --background: linear-gradient(var(--base-color), black); /* depth = 2 */
}
```

2 out of 3 custom properties examined (67%) had a depth of 0, and 30% had a depth of 1 (slightly less on mobile). Less than 1.8% had a depth of 2, and virtually none (0.7%) had a depth of 3+, which indicates rather basic usage. The upside of such basic usage is that it's harder to make mistakes: fewer than 0.5% of pages included cycles.


{{ figure_markup(
  image="custom-property-depth.png",
  caption="Distribution of depths of custom properties as a percent of occurrences.",
  description="Bar chart of the distribution of depths of custom properties as a percent of occurrences. Custom properties on desktop and mobile page have a depth of 0 for 67% and 60% of occurrences, respectively. For a depth of 1 it is 31% and 38%. At a depth of 2, just 2% each. Approximately 0% of occurrences have a depth of 3 or more.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=262191540&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1368222498",
  sql_file="custom_property_depth.sql"
) }}

Examining the selectors on which custom properties are declared further confirms that most custom property usage in the wild is fairly basic. Two out of three custom property declarations are on the root element, indicating that they are used essentially as global constants. It is important to note that many popular polyfills have required them to be global in this vein, so developers using said polyfills may not have had a choice.

## CSS and JS

### Houdini

You have likely heard of Houdini by now. Since [several Houdini specs have shipped in browsers](https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/), we figured it's time to see if they are actually used in the wild yet. Short answer: no. And now for the longer answer…

First, we looked at the [Properties & Values API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS/RegisterProperty), which allows developers to register a custom property and give it a type, an initial value, and prevent it from being inherited. One of the primary use cases is being able to animate custom properties, so we also looked at how frequently custom properties are being animated.

As is common with bleeding edge tech, especially when not supported in all browsers, adoption in the wild has been extremely low. Only 32 desktop and 20 mobile pages were found to have any registered custom properties, though this excludes custom properties that were registered but were not being applied at the time of the crawl. Only 325 mobile pages and 330 desktop ones (0.00%) use custom properties in animations, and most (74%) of that seems to be driven by a [Vue component](https://quasar.dev/vue-components/expansion-item). Virtually none of those appear to have registered them, though this is likely because the animation wasn't active at the time of the crawl, so there was no computed style needing to be registered.

The [Paint API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Painting_API) is a more broadly implemented Houdini spec which allows developers to create custom CSS functions that return `<image>` values, e.g. to implement custom gradients or patterns. Only 12 pages were found to be using `paint()`. Each worklet name (`hexagon`, `ruler`, `lozenge`, `image-cross`, `grid`, `dashed-line`, `ripple`) only appeared on one page each, so it appears the only in-the-wild use cases were likely demos.

[Typed OM](https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts/blob/master/css-typed-om/README.md), another Houdini specification, allows access to structured values instead of the strings of the classic CSS OM. It appears to have considerably higher adoption compared to other Houdini specs, though still low overall. It is used in 9,864 desktop pages (0.18%) and 6,391 mobile ones (0.1%). While this may seem low, to put it in perspective, these are similar numbers to the adoption of `<input type="date">`! Note that unlike most stats in this chapter, these numbers reflect actual usage, and not just inclusion in a website’s assets.

### CSS-in-JS

There is so much discussion (or argument) about CSS-in-JS that one could assume everyone and their dog is using it. However, when we looked at usage of various CSS-in-JS libraries, it turned out that only about 2% of websites use *any* CSS-in-JS method, with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) accounting for almost half of that.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="css-in-js.png",
  caption="Relative popularity of CSS-in-JS libraries as a percent of occurrences on mobile pages.",
  description="Pie chart of the relative popularity of CSS-in-JS libraries as a percent of occurrences on mobile pages.

## Internationalization

### Direction

When text is presented in horizontal lines, most writing systems display characters from left to right. Urdu, Arabic and Hebrew display characters from right to left, except for  numbers, which are written from left to right; they are bidirectional. Some characters  — such as brackets, quote marks, punctuation — could be used in either a left to right or a right to left context, and are said to be directionally neutral. Things get more complex when text strings of different languages are nested in one another - English text containing a short quote in Hebrew which contains some English words, for example. The Unicode bidirectional algorithm defines how to lay out paragraphs of mixed-direction text, but it needs to know the base direction of the paragraph.

To support bidirectionality,  explicit support for indicating direction is available in both HTML via ([the `dir` attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-dir-attribute) and the [`<bdo>` element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-bdo-element)), and CSS (the [direction](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#direction) and [`unicode-bidi`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-writing-modes-3/#unicode-bidi) properties. We looked at usage of both HTML and CSS methods.
Only 12.14% of pages on mobile (and a similar 10.76% on desktop) set the `dir` attribute on the `<html>` element. Which is fine: most writing systems in the world are **ltr**, and the default `dir` value is **ltr**. Of the pages which *did* set `dir` on `<html>`, 91% set it to `ltr` while 8.5% set it to `rtl` and 0.32% to `auto` (the explicit direction is unknown value, mainly useful for templates which will be filled with unknown content). An even smaller number, 2.63%, set `dir` on `<body>`. Which is good, because setting it on `<html>` also covers you for content in the `<head>`, like `<title>`.

Why set direction using HTML attributes rather than CSS styling? One reason is separation of concerns: direction has to do with content which is the purview of HTML. It is also the [recommended practice](https://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/bidi-xhtml/index.en): *“Avoid using CSS or Unicode control codes for managing direction where you can use markup”*. After all, the stylesheet might not load and the text still needs to be readable.

### Logical vs physical properties

Many of the first properties we are taught when we learn CSS, things like `width`, `height`, `margin-left`, `padding-bottom`, `right` and so on are grounded on a specific physical direction. However, when content needs to be presented in multiple languages with different directionality characteristics, these physical directions are often language dependent, e.g. `margin-left` often needs to become `margin-right` in a right-to-left language such as Arabic. Directionality is a 2D characteristic. For example, `height` may need to become `width` when we are presenting content in vertical writing (such as traditional Chinese).

In the past, the only solution to these problems was a separate stylesheet with overrides for different writing systems. However, more recently CSS has acquired [*logical* properties and values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties) that work just like their *physical* counterparts but are sensitive to the directionality of their context . For example, instead of `width` we could write `inline-size`, and instead of `left` we could use the [`inset-inline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset-inline) property. In addition to logical *properties*, there are also logical *keywords*, such as `float: inline-start` instead of `float: left`.

While these properties are fairly [well supported](https://caniuse.com/css-logical-props) (with some exceptions), they are not used very much outside of user agent stylesheets. None of the logical properties were used on more than 0.6% of pages. Most usage was to specify margins and paddings. Logical keywords for `text-align` were used on 2.25% of pages, but apart from that, none of the other keywords were even encountered at all. This is by large driven by browser support: `text-align: start` and `end` have [fairly good browser support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_text-align_flow_relative_values_start_and_end) whereas logical keywords for `clear` and `float` are only supported in Firefox.

## Browser support

### Vendor prefixes

Even though prefixing is now recognized as a failed way to introduce experimental features to developers, and browsers have largely stopped using it, opting for flags instead, a whopping 91% of pages still use at least one prefixed feature.

  image="vendor-prefix-features.png",
  caption="The most popular vendor-prefixed features by type as a percent of pages.",
  description="Bar chart of the most popular vendor-prefixed features by type as a percent of pages. Desktop and mobile are very similar. 91% of mobile pages use vendor-prefixed properties, 77% use keywords and pseudo-elements, 65% use functions, 61% use pseudo-classes, and 52% use media.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=1057411197&format=interactive",

  content="91.05%",
  classes="big-number",
  sheets_gid="1944012653",
  sql_file="vendor_prefix_summary.sql"
) }}

Prefixed properties take up the lion’s share of that, since **84% of all prefixed features used were properties**. This is most likely a remnant of the prefix-happy CSS3 era circa 2009-2014. This is also evident from the most popular prefixed ones, none of which have actually needed prefixes since 2014:

{{ figure_markup(
  image="vendor-prefix-properties.png",
  caption="Relative popularity of properties that are most used with vendor prefixes, as a percent of occurrences.",
  description="Bar chart of the relative popularity of properties that are most used with vendor prefixes, as a percent of occurrences. Desktop and mobile have similar results. The transform property makes up 19% of vendor prefix usage, followed by 12% transition, 9% border-radius, 8% box-shadow, 5% user-select and box-sizing, 4% animation, 3% filter, 2% each of font-smoothing, backface-visibility, appearance, and flex, and 1% usage for the remaining properties: transform-origin, osx-font-smoothing, animation-name, background-size, transition-property, and tap-highlight-color.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=859599479&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="67014375",
  sql_file="vendor_prefix_properties.sql"
) }}

Some of these prefixes, like `-moz-border-radius`, haven’t been useful since 2011. Even more mind-boggling, other prefixed properties that never existed, are still moderately common, with roughly 9% of all pages including `-o-border-radius`!

It may come as no surprise that `-webkit-` is by far the most popular prefix, with half of prefixed properties using it:

{{ figure_markup(
  image="top-vendor-prefixes.png",
  caption="Relative popularity of vendor prefixes, as a percent of occurrences.",
  description="Bar chart of the relative popularity of vendor prefixes, as a percent of occurrences. -webkit makes up 49% of vendor prefix usage on mobile pages, -moz 23%, -ms 19%, -o 8%, -khtml 1%, and 0% for -pie, -js, and -ie. Desktop is similar.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=702800205&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="67014375",
  sql_file="vendor_prefix_properties.sql"
) }}

Prefixed pseudo-classes are not nearly as common as properties, with none of them being used in more than 10% of pages. Nearly two thirds of all prefixed pseudo-classes **overall** are for styling placeholders. In contrast, the standard `:placeholder-shown` pseudo-class is barely used, encountered in less than 0.34% of pages.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="vendor-prefix-pseudo-classes.png",
  caption="The most popular vendor-prefixed pseudo-classes as a percent of pages.",
  description="Bar chart of the most popular vendor-prefixed pseudo-classes as a percent of pages. :ms-input-placeholder is used on 10% of mobile pages, :-moz-placeholder 8%, :-mox-focusring 2%, and 1% or less for the following: :-webkit-full-screen, :-moz-full-screen, :-moz-any-link, :-webkit-autofill, :-o-prefocus, :-ms-fullscreen, :-ms-input-placeholder [sic], :-ms-lang, :-moz-ui-invalid, :-webkit-input-placeholder, :-moz-input-placeholder, and :-webkit-any-link.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=1884876858&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="67014375",
  width="600",
  height="650",
  sql_file="vendor_prefix_pseudo_classes.sql"
) }}

The most common prefixed pseudo-element is `::-moz-focus-inner`, used to disable Firefox's inner focus ring. It makes up almost a quarter of prefixed pseudo-elements and for which there is no standard alternative. Another quarter of prefixed pseudo-elements is yet again for styling placeholders, while the standard version, `::placeholder`, trails far behind, used in only 4% of pages.

The remaining half of prefixed pseudo-elements is primarily devoted to styling scrollbars and Shadow DOM of native elements (search inputs, video & audio controls, spinner buttons, sliders, meters, progress bars). This indicates a strong developer need for customization of built-in UI controls, for which standards-compliant CSS still falls short, although there are [multiple ongoing](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4410) CSS WG [discussions](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5187) to ameliorate that.

It is no secret that Chrome and Safari have been way more prefix-happy, but it is especially true with pseudo-elements: nearly half of all prefixed pseudo-elements we found had a `-webkit-` prefix.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="top-pseudo-element-prefixes.png",
  caption="Relative popularity of pseudo-element vendor prefixes as a percent of occurrences on mobile pages.",
  description="Pie chart of the relative popularity of pseudo-element vendor prefixes as a percent of occurrences on mobile pages. -webkit makes up 47% of pseudo-element vendor prefix usage, followed by, 26% -moz, 15% -ms, 7% -o, and 6% other.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRpe_HsNGpekn6YZV9k6QGmcZPxalqnDrL7DrDY-7X65RZEf_-aGfWuEvhk-yWV83ctIceE1bppCLpj/pubchart?oid=744523431&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1466863581",
  sql_file="vendor_prefix_pseudo_elements.sql"
) }}

Nearly all usage of prefixed functions (98%) is to specify gradients, even though [this has not been necessary since 2014](https://caniuse.com/css-gradients). The most popular of these is `-webkit-linear-gradient()` used in over a quarter of pages examined. The remaining <2% is primarily for calc, [for which a prefix has not been necessary since 2013](https://caniuse.com/calc).

{{ figure_markup(
  caption="Percent of gradient functions across all occurrences of vendor-prefixed functions in mobile pages",
  content="98.22%",
  classes="big-number",
  sheets_gid="1586213539",
  sql_file="vendor_prefix_functions.sql"
) }}

Usage of prefixed media features is lower overall, with the most popular one, `-webkit-min-pixel-ratio` used in 13% of pages to detect "Retina" displays. The corresponding standard media feature, [`resolution`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/resolution) has finally surpassed it in popularity and is used in 1,373,813 mobile pages (22%) and 811,411 desktop pages (15%).

Overall, `-*-min-pixel-ratio` comprises three quarters of prefixed media features on desktop and about half on mobile. The reason for the difference is not reduced mobile usage, but that another prefixed media feature, `-*-high-contrast`, is far more popular on mobile making up almost the entire other half of prefixed media features, but only 18% on desktop. The corresponding standard media feature, [forced-colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/forced-colors) is still experimental and behind a flag in Chrome and Firefox, and thus, did not appear at all in our analysis.

### Feature queries

Feature queries ([@supports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports)) have been steadily gaining traction for the past few years, and were used in 39% of pages, a notable increase from last year's 30%.

But what are they used for? We looked at the most popular queries. The results may come as a big surprise — it was to us! We expected grid-related queries to top the list, but instead, the most popular feature queries **by far** are for `position: sticky`! They comprise **half** of all feature queries and are used in about a quarter of pages. In contrast, grid-related queries account for only 2% of all queries, indicating that developers feel comfortable enough with Grid's browser support that they don’t need to use it only as progressive enhancement.

What is even more mysterious is that `position: sticky` itself is not used as much as the feature queries about it, appearing in 10% of desktop pages and 13% of mobile pages. So there are over half a million pages that detect `position: sticky` without ever using it! Why?!

Lastly, it was encouraging to see `max()` already in the top 10 most detected features, appearing in 0.6% of desktop pages and 0.7% of mobile pages. Given that `max()` (and `min()`, and `clamp()`) was [only supported across the board this year](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_max), it is quite impressive adoption and highlights how desperately developers needed this.

A small but notable number of pages (around 3000 or 0.05%) were oddly using `@supports` with CSS 2 syntax, such as `display: block` or `padding: 0px`, syntax that existed well before `@supports` was implemented. It is unclear what this was meant to achieve. Perhaps it was used to shield CSS rules from old browsers that don't implement `@supports`?

### Declaration repetition

To tell how efficient and maintainable a stylesheet is, one rough factor is declaration repetition, that is, the ratio between unique (different) and total number of declarations. The factor is a rough one because it’s not trivial to normalize declarations (`border: none`, `border: 0`, even `border-width: 0`—plus a few more—are all different but say the same thing), and also because there are levels for the repetition: media query (most useful but harder to measure), style sheet, or data set level as with the Almanac's overall metrics.

We did look at declaration repetition and found that the median web page, on mobile, uses a total of 5,454 declarations, of which 2,398 are unique. The median ratio (which is based on the data set, not these two values) comes out at 45.43%. What this means is that on the median page, each declaration is used roughly two times.

These ratios are better, then, than what we know from scarce previous data. In 2017, Jens Oliver Meiert [sampled 220 popular websites](https://meiert.com/en/blog/70-percent-css-repetition/) and came out with the following averages: 6,121 declarations, of which 1,698 were unique, and a unique/total ratio of 28% (median 34%). The topic could need further investigation, but from the little we know so far, declaration repetition is tangible—and may have either improved, or be more of a problem for the more popular and likely larger sites.

### Shorthands and longhands

Some shorthands are more successful than others. Sometimes the shorthand is sufficiently easy to use and its syntax memorable, that we end up only using the longhands intentionally, when we want to override certain values independently. And then there are these shorthands that are hardly ever used because their syntax is too confusing.

#### Shorthands before longhands

Some shorthands are more successful than others. Sometimes the shorthand is sufficiently easy to use and its syntax memorable, that we end up only using the longhands intentionally, when we want to override certain values independently. And then there are these shorthands that are hardly ever used because their syntax is too confusing.
Shorthands before longhands
Using a shorthand and overriding it with a few longhands in the same rule is a good strategy for a variety of reasons:

First, it's good defensive coding. The shorthand resets all its longhands to their initial values if they have not been explicitly specified. This prevents rogue values coming in through the cascade.

Second, it's good for maintainability, to avoid repetition of values when the shorthand has smart defaults. For example, instead of `margin: 1em 1em 0 1em` we can write:

```css
margin: 1em;
margin-bottom: 0;
```

Similarly, for list-valued properties, longhands can help us reduce repetition when a value is the same across all list values:

```css
background: url("one.png"), url("two.png"), url("three.png");
background-repeat: no-repeat;
```
Third, for cases where parts of the shorthand’s syntax are too weird, longhands can help improve readability:

```css
/* Instead of: */
background: url("one.svg") center / 50% 50% content-box border-box;

/* This is more readable: */
background: url("one.svg") center;
background-size: 50% 50%;
background-origin: content-box;
background-clip: border-box;
```

So how frequently does this occur? *Very*, as it turns out. 88% of pages use this strategy at least once. By far, the most frequent longhand this happens with is `background-size`, accounting for 40% of all longhands that come after their shorthand, indicating that the slash syntax for `background-size` in `background` may not have been the most readable or memorable syntax we could have come up with. No other longhand comes close to this frequency. The remaining 60% is a long tail spread across many other properties evenly.

#### font

The `font` shorthand is fairly popular (used 49 million times on 80% of pages) but used far less than most of its longhands (except `font-variant` and `font-stretch`). This indicates that most developers are comfortable using it (since it appears on so many websites). Developers often need to override specific typographic aspects on descendant rules, which likely explains why the longhands are used so much more.

  sheets_gid="1513860089",
  sql_file="all_properties.sql"
) }}

#### background

As one of the oldest shorthands, `background` is also highly used, appearing 1 billion times in 92% of pages. It's used more frequently than any of its longhands except `background-color` which is used 1.5 billion times, in roughly the same number of pages. However, this doesn’t mean developers are fully comfortable with all of its syntax: nearly all (>90%) of `background` usage is very simple, with one or two values, most likely colors and images or images and positions. For anything further, the longhands are seen as more self-explanatory.

#### Margins and paddings

Both the `margin` and `padding` shorthands, as well as their longhands were some of the most highly used CSS properties. Padding is considerably more likely to be specified as a shorthand (1.5B uses for `padding` vs 300-400M for each shorthand), whereas there is less of a difference for margin (1.1B uses of `margin` vs 500-800M for each of its longhands). Given the initial confusion of many CSS developers about the clockwise order of values in these shorthands and the repetition rule for 2 or 3 values, we expected that most of these uses of the shorthands would be simple (1 value), however we saw the entire range of 1,2,3 or 4 values. Obviously 1 or 2 values were more common, but 3 or 4 were not at all uncommon, occurring in over 25% of `margin` uses and over 10% of `padding` usage.

  sheets_gid="1513860089",
  sql_file="all_properties.sql"
) }}

#### Flex

Nearly all `flex`, `flex-*` properties are very highly used, appearing in 30-60% of pages. However, both `flex-wrap` and `flex-direction` are used far more than their shorthand, `flex-flow`. When `flex-flow` *is* used, it is used with two values, i.e. as a shorter way to set both of its longhands. Despite the [elaborate sensible defaults](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex#Syntax:~:text=The%20flex%20property%20may%20be%20specified%20using%20one%2C%20two%2C%20or%20three%20values) for using `flex` with one or two values,  around 90% of usage consists of the 3 value syntax, explicitly setting all three of its longhands.

#### Grid

Did you know that `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-template-areas` are actually shorthands of `grid-template`? Did you know that there’s a `grid` property and all of those are some of its longhands? No? Well, you’re in good company: neither do most developers. The `grid` property was only used in 5,279 websites (0.08%) and `grid-template` on 8,215 websites (0.13%). In comparison, `grid-template-columns` is used in 1.7 million websites, over 200 times more!

### CSS mistakes

#### Syntax errors

For most of the metrics in this chapter, we used [Rework](https://github.com/reworkcss/css), a CSS parser. While this helps dramatically improve accuracy, it also means we could be less forgiving of syntax errors compared to a browser. Even if one declaration in the entire stylesheet has a syntax error, parsing would fail and that stylesheet would be left out of the analysis. But how many stylesheets *do* contain such syntax errors? Quite substantially more on desktop than mobile it turns out! More specifically, nearly 10% of stylesheets found on desktop pages included at least one unrecoverable syntax error, whereas only 2% of mobile. Do note that these are essentially lower bounds for syntax errors, since not all syntax errors actually cause parsing to fail. For example, a missing semicolon would just result in the next declaration being parsed as part of the value (e.g. `{property: "color", value: "red background: yellow"}`), it would not cause the parser to fail.

#### Nonexistent properties

We also looked at most common nonexistent properties, by using a list of known properties. We excluded prefixed properties from this part of the analysis, and manually excluded unprefixed proprietary properties (e.g. IE’s `behavior`, which oddly still appears on 200K websites). Out of the remaining nonexistent properties:

- 37% of them were a mangled form of a prefixed property (e.g. `webkit-transition` or `-transition`)
- 43% were an unprefixed form of a property that only exists only prefixed (e.g. `font-smoothing`, which appeared on 384K websites), probably included for compatibility under the incorrect assumption that it's standard, or due to wishful thinking that it will become standard.
- A typo that has found its way to a popular library. Through this analysis, we found that the property `white-wpace` was present in 234,027 websites. This is way too many websites for the same typo to have occurred organically, so we decided to look into it. And lo and behold, it [turns out](https://twitter.com/rick_viscomi/status/1326739379533000704) it was the Facebook widget! The fix is already in.
- And another oddity: The property `font-rendering` appears on 2,575 pages. However, we cannot find evidence of such a property existing, with or without a prefix. There is the nonstandard [`-webkit-font-smoothing`](https://medium.com/better-programming/improving-font-rendering-with-css-3383fc358cbc) which is wildly popular, appearing in 3 million websites, or about 49% of pages, but `font-rendering` is not sufficiently close to be a misspelling. There is [`text-rendering`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-rendering) which is used in about 100K of websites, so it is conceivable that 2.5K developers all misremembered and coined a portmanteau of `font-smoothing` and `text-rendering`.

#### Longhands before shorthands

Using longhands *after* shorthands is a nice way to use the defaults and override a few properties. It is especially useful with list-valued properties, where using a longhand helps us avoid repeating the same value multiple times. The **opposite** on the other hand — using longhands *before* shorthands — is always a mistake, since the shorthand will overwrite the longhand. For example, take a look at this:

```css
background-color: rebeccapurple; /* longhand */
background: linear-gradient(white, transparent); /* shorthand */
```

This will not produce a gradient from `white` to `rebeccapurple`, but from `white` to `transparent`. The `rebeccapurple` background color will be overwritten by the `background` shorthand that comes after it that resets all its longhands to their initial values.

There are two main reasons that developers make this kind of mistake: either a misunderstanding about how shorthands work and which longhand is reset by which shorthand, or simply leftover cruft from moving declarations around.

So how common is this mistake? Surely, it cannot be *that* common in the top 6 million websites, right? *Wrong.* It turns out, it is **exceedingly common**, occurring at least once in 54% of websites!

This kind of confusion seems to happen way more with the `background` shorthand than any other shorthand: over half (55%) of these mistakes involve putting `background-*` longhands before `background`. In this case, this may actually not be a mistake at all, but good progressive enhancement: Browsers that don’t support a feature -- such as linear gradients -- will render the previously defined longhand values, in this case, a background color. Browsers that do understand the shorthand override the longhand value, either implicitly or explicitly.

## Sass

While analyzing CSS code tells us what CSS developers *are* doing, looking at preprocessor code can tell us a bit about what CSS developers *want* to be doing, but *can't*, which in some ways is more interesting. We used CSS files with sourcemaps to extract and analyze SCSS stylesheets in the wild. We chose to look at SCSS because it's the most popular preprocessing syntax, based on our analysis of sourcemaps.

We've known for a while that developers need color modification functions, and are working on them in [CSS Color 5](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-5/). However, analyzing SCSS function calls gives us hard data to prove just how necessary color modification functions are, and also tells us *which* types of color modifications are most commonly needed.

Overall, over one third of all Sass function calls are to modify colors or extract color components. Virtually all color modifications we found were rather simple. **Half** were to make colors darker. In fact, `darken()` was the most popular Sass function call overall, used even more than the generic `if()`! It appears that a common strategy is to define bright core colors, and use `darken()` to create darker variations. The opposite, making them lighter, is less common, with only 5% of function calls being `lighten()`, though that was still the 6th most popular function overall.  Functions that change the alpha channel were about 4% of overall function calls and mixing colors makes up 3.5% of all function calls. Other types of color modifications such as adjusting hue, saturation, red/green/blue channels, or the more complex `adjust-color()` were used very sparingly.

) }}

Defining custom functions is something that has been [discussed for years in Houdini](https://github.com/w3c/css-houdini-drafts/issues/857), but studying Sass stylesheets gives us data on how common the need is. Quite common, it turns out. At least **half** of SCSS stylesheets studied contain custom functions, since the median SCSS sheet contains not one, but two custom functions.

There are also [recent](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5009) [discussions](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5624) in the CSS WG about introducing a limited form of conditionals, and Sass gives us some data on how commonly this is needed. Almost two thirds of SCSS sheets contain at least one `@if` block, making up almost two thirds of all control flow statements. There is also an `if()` function for conditionals within values, which is the second most common function used overall (14%).

Another future spec that is currently worked on is [CSS Nesting](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting/), which will afford us the ability to nest rules within other rules similarly to what we can do in Sass and other preprocessors by using `&`. How commonly is nesting used in SCSS sheets? **Very**, it turns out. The vast majority of SCSS sheets use at least one explicitly nested selector, with pseudo-classes (e.g. `&:hover`) and classes (e.g. `&.active`) making up three quarters of it. And this does not account for implicit nesting, where a descendant is assumed and the `&` character is not required.

## Conclusion

**Whew!** That was a lot of data! We hope you have found it as interesting as we did, and perhaps even formed your own insights about some of them.

One of our takeaways was that popular libraries such as WordPress, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome are primary drivers behind adoption of new features, while individual developers tend to be more conservative.

Another observation is that there is more old code on the Web than new code. The Web in practice spans a huge range, from code that could have been written 20 years ago to bleeding edge tech that only works in the latest browsers. What this study showed us, though, is that there are powerful features that are often misunderstood and underused, despite good interoperability.

It also showed us some of the ways that developers want to use CSS but can't, and gave us some insight on what they find confusing. Some of this data will be brought back to the CSS WG to help drive CSS's evolution, because data-driven decisions are the best kind of decisions.

We are excited about the ways that this analysis could have further impact in the way we develop websites, and looking forward to seeing how these metrics develop over time!
