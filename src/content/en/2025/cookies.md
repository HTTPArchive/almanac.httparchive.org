## Introduction

[Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) allow websites to save data and maintain state information across HTTP requests, a stateless protocol. Web applications use cookies for several purposes, like authentication, fraud prevention and security, or remembering preferences and user choices, etc. However, ever since their introduction in the mid-1990s, cookies have also played a dominant role in online tracking of web users.

Over the years, browser vendors such as Brave, Firefox, and Safari have imposed restrictions, partitioned, and removed third-party cookies. If initially Google Chrome appeared to follow in these steps by announcing [plans to block all third-party cookies](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/01/building-more-private-web-path-towards.html), several delays and postponements later, Google eventually decided to [maintain their current approach in Chrome](https://privacysandbox.com/news/update-on-plans-for-privacy-sandbox-technologies/).

As a result, cookies—the focus of this 2025 Web Almanac Chapter—remain an essential component in today's web landscape. Next, we measure the prevalence and structure of web cookies encountered while visiting the top one million (top 1M) websites during the HTTP Archive crawl of July 2025.

## Background

To avoid repetitions and overlap here with concepts and definitions from the 2024 Cookies chapter, we refer interested readers to last year's [Definitions section](../2024/cookies#definitions) for an overview of the different types of cookies and the privacy and security risks they can pose.
