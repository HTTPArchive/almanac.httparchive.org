## Introduction
Cascading Style Sheets are used to paint, format, and layout web pages. Their capabilities span concepts as simple as text color to 3D perspective. It also has hooks to empower developers to handle varying screen sizes, viewing contexts, and printing. CSS helps developers wrangle the content and ensure it's adapting properly the requesting user.

When describing CSS to those not familiar with web technology, it can be helpful to think of it as the language to paint the walls of the house, describe the size and position of windows and doors, as well as flourishing decorations such as wallpaper or plant life. The fun twist to that story, is that depending on who is walking through the house, a developer can adapt to their preferences or contexts!

In this chapter, we'll be inspecting, tallying, and extracting datums about how CSS is used across the web. The goal is to understand holistically what is being used, how they're using it, and to use that information to help inform ourselves (and you) how CSS is growing and being adopted. 

Ready to dig into the fascinating data!?

## Custom Properties
Custom Properties are what many call CSS variables. They're more dynamic than a typical static variable though! They're very powerful and I feel as a community we're still discovering their potential.
