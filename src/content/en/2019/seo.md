------

10.01 - Structured data rich results eligibility (ratings, search, etc,)
10.02 - Lang attribute usage and mistakes (lang='en')
10.03 -`<link>` rel="amphtml" (AMP)
10.04 - `<link>` hreflang="en-us" (localisation usage)
10.05 - Breakdown of type of structured data served (ld+json, microformatting, schema.org + what `@type`)?
10.06 - Indexability - looking at meta tags like `<meta>` noindex, `<link>` canonicals.
10.07 - `<meta>` description + `<title>` (presence & length)
10.08 - Status codes and whether pages are accessible - 200, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx.
10.09 - Content - looking at word count, thin pages, header usage, alt attributes images
10.10 - Linking - extract `<a href>` count per page (internal + external)
10.11 - Linking - fragment URLs (together with SPAs to navigate content)
10.12- robots.txt (It is mentioned in Lighthouse, can we parse the content or only confirm its existence? E.g. check if has a sitemap reference - seems it does list the potential issues)
10.13- If the desktop site is responsive/mobile-ready, or a specific mobile site (redirect, UA)? (Can we find if these are different sites?)
10.14 - Descriptive link text usage (available in Lighthouse data)
10.15 - speed metrics (FCP, server response time) would be nice for SEO as well given the recent focus on fast loading sites
