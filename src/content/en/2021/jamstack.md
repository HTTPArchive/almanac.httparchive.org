## Introduction

 <figure>
  <blockquote>Jamstack has revolutionized the way we think about building for the web by providing a simpler developer experience, better performance, lower cost and greater scalability.</blockquote>

</figure>

Jamstack stands on JavaScript, API, and Markup architecture. These 3 foundations are decoupled and the Jamstack site can be built purely using markup. Using pure HTML - is "kinda" Jamstack, but it's really hard to scale. Lucky for us, there's a huge ecosystem of Static Site Generators (SSGs).

JavaScript based:
* Next.js
* Gatsby
* Nuxt.js
* etc

Old-fashioned:
* Eleventy
* Hugo
* Jekyll
* Hexo
* etc

And [there are many more SSGs beyond these](https://jamstack.org/generators/).

They allow building sites converted to "pure" HTML and JavaScript goodness if needed.

For more complex sites, data has to be structured. There are several ways to store and manage data using [headless CMSs](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/) via API.

Moreover, Jamstack sites need support for server interactions. Like form submittions or user input processing. Services like Netlify provides [serverless functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/) support.

The goal of this chapter is to identify what's the main SSGs used on Jamstack.Adoption of Jamstack technology year over year. Will answer how they are distributed around the world, what is the performance of Jamstack sites and how it is growing. Explore data of different CDN providers for Jamstack sites. Dive into results of resources used for Jamstack sites and their impact on user experiance.

Worth to mention some data disclaimers:
1. HTTPArchive data of detected SSGs is based on Wappalyzer technology. It can't detect whether the site was built with Eleventy. Also, it can't detect if the site was generated by Next.js [Static Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) or [Server Side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering).
2. In our analysis, we can't get any info related to headless CMSs, hence we will not cover this part either.
3. We visualise SSG data using top 5 used SSGs based on number of sites built with these SSGs.

Most of the data is represented for mobile and desktop websites. There's a fully described [​​methodology](./methodology) used in HTTPArchive.

## Adoption of SSGs

We will take a look what's the adoption rate of SSGs among web.
### Ranking

Let's start with ranking and understand which SSG is most popular.
Nuxt.js covers 51% of Jamstack sites. Next.js is in second place with 35.1%, third one is Gatsby with 7.3%.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="adoption-share.png",
  caption="SSG adoption share",
  description="Pie chart represents adoption share between SSGs. Nuxt.js covers 51% of Jamstack sites. Next.js is in second place with 35.1%, third one is Gatsby with 7.3%.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=2020451260&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1005292860",
  sql_file="adoption.sql"
) }}

Next.js shows great results when exploring data of popular sites. 13% of the top 1000 sites are Next.js. Nuxt.js has 5% and Gatsby - 0.2%.

Next.js remains a popular SSG for top 10K. In the top 100K Next.js and Nuxt.js remain equal. Really interesting that Gatsby keeps all numbers pretty equal across all sites categories.

  sheets_gid="1005292860",
  sql_file="adoption.sql"
) }}

### Adoption year over year

SSG adoption year over year in general is growing 2x times. In 2019 it was just 0.4% mobile and 0.3% desktop sites. In 2020 the number almost doubled, 0.6% - mobile and 0.7% - desktop sites. In 2021 they goring as well. 1.1% - mobile and 0.9% - desktop sites.
That underlines the trend of that technology. For example, this year a company like Vercel raised a $104M series C round and $150M in round D of investment to build a better web with modern technologies like Next.js. Also Jamstack oriented CDN provider - Netlify raised $105M in their series D of investment. Hence, it's expected that numbers of Jamstack adoption will grow even higher next year.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="year-over-year-adoption.png",
  caption="SSG adoption year over year",
  description="Bar chart represents adoption year over year. Adoption year over year in general is growing 2x times.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1588757197&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="874607830",
  sql_file="ssg_compared_to_2020.sql"
) }}

In 2020 the amount of desktop websites increased 2.76 times, while mobile just 1.5 times. In 2021 mobile availability for SSGs built sites became way better than in 2020, and this year there are ~1.9 times more sites than 2020.

## Geographic adoption

In this section we will go over geographic adoption for Jamstack. Explore distribution over countries and regions.

### Adoption by Country

SSGs are heavily used around the world, here're 10 countries with the highest number of sites. In the USA 1% of all sites pages, which is about 22K pages for desktop and 16K for mobile, are created with SSG. India has a lower number of pages, just 6K for desktop and 7K for mobile, but 1.7% of all pages is covered by Jamstack technologies. Third is United Kingdom, which also has 1.7% of pages.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-adoption-by-country.png",
  caption="SSG adoption by country",
  description="Bar chart represents SSG adoption by country. SSG adoption year over year in general is growing 2x times.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=778184046&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1956913376",
  sql_file="adoption_by_geo.sql"
) }}

Real interesting is exploring SSGs distribution over countries. USA has Next.js adoption over Nuxt.js and Gatsby. It keeps trending in almost all countries.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-distribution-by-country.png",
  caption="SSG distribution by country",
  description="Bar chart represents SSG distribution by country. Next.js has higher adoption over Nuxt.js and Gatsby in almost all countries.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=533375815&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1956913376",
  sql_file="adoption_by_geo.sql"
) }}

In most countries, Next.js is a preferable choice. Interesting that Gatsby has no data for 3 of the top 10 countries using Jamstack technologies, but in 2 of them Japan and Russian Federation Nuxt.js is more preferable.
### Adoption by region

Trend over countries applies for regions, that's interesting as well.

Number of sites in Europe for desktop is 23K versus mobile 26K, that's 1.1% of all web sites in that region. In the Americas, there're 26K desktop sites versus 24K mobiles sites, 1.2% of sites. In any case, Europe has tiny bit lower adoption of Jamstack than the Americas. Asia has almost the same numbers, 21K desktop and 22K mobile as leading regions but greater Jamstack adoption, 1.45%. We saw that overall site adoption is 1.1%, but looks like Asia is going further with it and drives trends there.

Oceania and Africa have way lower overall numbers, but they have way greater Jamstack adoption. Oceania 2.19% and Africa 2%.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-adoption-by-region.png",
  caption="SSG distribution by region",
  description="Bar chart represents SSG distribution by region. Europe has 1.1%, Americas 1.2%, Asia 1.45%, Oceania 2.19% and Africa 2% among all sites by region.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=805975078&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1779595527",
  sql_file="adoption_by_region.sql"
) }}

### Adoption by subregion

Subregions give us good enough granularity and some exciting data. Not a surprise that first in a list stands for Northern America and USA location and driver of technologies. Most companies who invented SSGs are in the USA. But surprisingly, Western Europe is in second place. It has 10K mobile sites versus Northern America -  17K, but almost the same adoption level, 1.1%. Hence, Western Europe together with Northern Europe have more than 20K sites with 1.4% of Jamstack adoption, which is more than the territory it's invented.

The tail also shows great results. Subregions with lower number of sites in general adopt technology even broader, like 4.8% of Micronesia sites.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-adoption-by-subregion.png",
  caption="SSG distribution by sub region",
  description="Bar chart represents SSG distribution by sub region. Median values are aroun 1.1% among all sub region. Only subregions with lower number of sites in general adopt technology even broader, like 4.8% of Micronesia sites.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=4263440&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="72886421",
  sql_file="adoption_by_subregion.sql"
) }}

### Summary of adoption by regions

SSG technology is adopted not only by places where it's invented and popularized, but also all around the world. Moreover, in places where the next generation of the web will be built, it grows even faster, mostly 2 times and sometimes 4 times, compared to others.

## SSGs distribution among CDN providers

We described how SSGs are adopted in different countries, so let's analyse which SSG is most popular among different CDN providers.

There's 7 most popular CDN providers for SSGs

* Netlify
* Vercel
* Cloudflare
* AWS
* Azure
* Akamai
* GitHub

Note: GitHub as CDN provider might be questioned, but GitHub offers a feature called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which allows users to deploy sites on github.io with subdomain using built in Jekyll SSG.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-distribution-over-cdn.png",
  caption="SSG distribution over CDN",
  description="Bar chart represents SSG distribution over CDN.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1366870673&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1565107748",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_distribution.sql"
) }}

Next.js, as most popular by data we have, mostly served by Cloudflare, Vercel, and AWS. Most of Gatsby's sites use Netlify, AWS, and Cloudflare.

Nuxt.js sites preferred to be served by Cloudflare, AWS, and Netlify.

Hugo mostly uses Netlify, and Jekyll as no surprise mostly on GitHub.

Fair to say that in real world, Cloudflare is used not only for pure serving as CDN but as protection service, DNS balancing etc. So, keep in mind that Cloudflare results can be false positives.

Putting Cloudflare aside for a while, we can see interesting data about Next.js. Next.js is mostly served by Vercel (company invented Next.js), and also Next.js heavily served by AWS. Together with Nuxt.js and Gatsby, we can define that AWS as a Jamstack oriented service has made great progress on serving Jamstack sites together with Jamstack oriented services like Netlify and Vercel.

On following graph it's more clear which SSGs mostly delivered by which CDN.

## User experiance and performance

In our research we want to explore what's real user experaince for 1.1% adopetd Jamstack technology sites. We will take a look at Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals results.

### Lighthouse

All Lighthouse scores are median values for mobile devices. Hence, these are results from all around the world. There might be influence of using mobile data providers or devices with simpler hardware then top edge devices of 2021.
#### Performance score

Median performance score for all SSGs across mobile varies. Top 3 SSGs with data can't even pass 40 breier. Since they are pretty much popular in top ranking sites, and distributed all around the world, as we saw on data before, we can make the assumption that they are used from different devices and different networks. Nevertheless, we expect more out-of-the-box improvements like [Next.js image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) which improves performance.

Jekyll is one of a kind, making almost 70 which is great results for such a mastodon in the SSG area.  Learn more about [Lighthouse performance audit](https://web.dev/lighthouse-performance/).

{{ figure_markup(

  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1829586779&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="745310638",
  sql_file="median_lighthouse_score.sql"
) }}

#### Accessibility score

Due to specific [Lighthouse measurements of accessibility](https://web.dev/lighthouse-accessibility/) we can make an assumption that these are pretty much good results.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="median-lighthouse-accessibility-score.png",
  caption="Median Lighthouse accessibility score",
  description="Bar chart represents median Lighthouse accessibility score.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1270511864&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="745310638",
  sql_file="median_lighthouse_score.sql"
) }}
#### SEO score

All Jamstack sites provide great SEO scores. From 90 to 92.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="median-lighthouse-seo-score.png",
  caption="Median Lighthouse SEO score",
  description="Bar chart represents median Lighthouse SEO score. All Jamstack sites provide great SEO scores. From 90 to 92.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=813819935&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="745310638",
  sql_file="median_lighthouse_score.sql"
) }}

#### Best Practices score

[Lighthouse Best Practices](https://web.dev/lighthouse-best-practices/) category makes sure that site avoids using unhealthy common patterns which dramatically changes User Experience. One of the examples - "document.write()", etc. All sites results mostly 87, and 93 for for some of them.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="median-lighthouse-best-practices-score.png",
  caption="Median Lighthouse best practices score",
  description="Bar chart represents median Lighthouse best practices score.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=343006289&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="745310638",
  sql_file="median_lighthouse_score.sql"
) }}

The bottomline here is that Lighthouse results in general are good, but performance and PWA should be the main target for SSGs, these categories need some work to improve developer experience out of the box, hence the end result of sites performance will be improved.
## Core Web Vitals

[Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/learn-web-vitals/) (CWV) - an initiative to provide unified guidance for quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web. CWV itself uses 3 performance metrics:

We gathered  data for SSGs and also for CDNs which deliver Jamstack sites.

In overall assessment for SSGs we can understand the basic performance level of Jamstack sites. CWV assessment contains data of 75% percentile of page loads  which have a good score of CWV across all metrics.

Looking at mobile results, Jekyll and Hugo have the best results over SSGs. 33% and 32% of all sites scored good.

Gatsby is third with 21%, but it's the first from JavaScript based SSGs. Another one is Next.js with 15% of good performance pagesm and Nuxt.js has 11%.

  sheets_gid="1340534640",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_passing.sql"
) }}

### Largest Contentful Paint of SSGs

[Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP) - The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport, relative to when the page first started loading.

In average user experience, the best results show Hugo and Jekyll. 88% and 90% are under 2.5s. Gatsby - 78%. Next.js has almost 72% and Nuxt.js - 69%.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="LCP-distribution-SSG.png",
  caption="LCP distribution for SSGs",
  description="Stacked Bar chart represents LCP distribution for SSGs",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=782586905&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1024061881",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_distribution.sql"
) }}

The same results are approved by percent of sites with good LCP experience.

  sheets_gid="1340534640",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_passing.sql"
) }}


Jamstack sites delivered by GitHub have 80% of good LCP. Netlify as Jamstack oriented goes next with 64% and Vercel with 62%. AWS and Cloudflare have 57% and 51%.

### First Input Delay

[First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/) (FID) - FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (i.e. when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.

All SSGs are from 96% to 99%. Great experience!

{{ figure_markup(
  image="FID-distribution-SSG.png",
  caption="FID distribution for SSGs",
  description="Stacked Bar chart represents FID distribution for SSGs",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1025201906&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1024061881",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_distribution.sql"
) }}

On real user experience, FID shows great results too across different SSGs.

  sheets_gid="1340534640",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_passing.sql"
) }}

All CDNs deliver Jamstack sites with 90% good FID, except Cloudflare.

{{ figure_markup(

  sheets_gid="1024061881",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_distribution.sql"
) }}

### Cumulative Layout Shift

[Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLF) - is a measure of the largest burst of _layout shift scores_ for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of a page.

Again, Jekyll shows great performance here. 88% are good results. Then Hugo - 85%, Gatsby - 82%, Next.js - 75%, and Nuxt.js 75%.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="CLS-distribution-SSG.png",

  sheets_gid="1024061881",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_distribution.sql"
) }}

As well as other CLS for real websites has the same trend.

  sheets_gid="1340534640",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_passing.sql"

In general CWV results reflect Lighthouse results. Huge and Jekyll have better real user performance data. We can't  detect how complicated sites were built with these SSGs. I can bet that with modern SSGs like Next.js, Nuxt.js, Gatsby there are a lot of JavaScript delivered, more data to render including images. Hence, it affects performance results. Nevertheless, an interesting correlation between GitHub and Jekyll, which in tandem shows great results.

## Resources

Let's dive into resource weights between top 5 SSGs to understand its influence on performance. The results represent median values.
### Resources weight

JavaScript based SSGs have almost 2x larger amount of resources then Hugo and Jekyll. Top one is ~2MB for Nuxt.js, then goes Next.js and Gatsby with almost 1.8MB and 1.7MB.

  sheets_gid="984097158",
  sql_file="resource_weights.sql"
) }}

### JavaScript

Big chunk of resources use JavaScript. Again, for JavaScript based SSGs it's a huge number compared to others. From 746KB to 645KB. Next.js based sites use more JavaScript than others.

  sheets_gid="984097158",
  sql_file="resource_weights.sql"
) }}

We analysed which third party libraries were used among SSGs. We excluded React and Vue to have a clear picture of other libraries and frameworks represented among SSGs.

Surprise for us was jQuery.  It wasn't a surprise that it's used for Hugo and Jekyll based sites, but that it's used inside React and Vue based sites!!! Next.js, Nuxt,js, and Gatsby based sites use jQuery, for Nuxt.js sites it's 25% among other third party libraries.

Styled-components used for Next.js and Gatsby sites and takes ~40% of all third party libraries. Amotion tries to fight styled-components.

Lodash is also one of a kind. Like jQuery. Developers like and use it as well.
Nuxt.js - 34%, Next.js - 21%, Gatsby - 12%.

 Note that this data aggregates all of the pages for different sites, hence e.g. 25% of jQuery usage among other 3rd parties can happen for some Nuxt.js sites and might not happen for other of sites at all.

  sheets_gid="434923317",
  sql_file="framework_libraries.sql"
) }}

### CSS

On the other hand, CSS is heavier than Hugo and Jekyll. 29Kb and 23Kb.

  sheets_gid="984097158",
  sql_file="resource_weights.sql"
) }}

### Images

Images weights distributed differently. There's no correlation between SSG groups.

Nuxt.js has the highest value - 645Kb. Then Hugo, 522Kb. Next.js and Gatsby almost the same, 465Kb and 545Kb. Jekyll has the lowest value - 295Kb.

) }}

#### Images format adoption

Images, one of the bottlenecks of good User Experience (UX). If they are huge sizes - the user waits a long time for the image to be delivered. It leads to content jumps and other different problems.

Next generation of image formats - [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/) has 17% of usage among Jamstack sites.

Still, most used is JPEG - 29% and GIF - 27%. SVG is used on 19% of webpages.

Compared to last year's [results](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/jamstack#image-formats), when WebP had only 3%, we can say it's a great improvement over one year.

) }}

Data of resource weights confirms that performance of Next.js, Nuxt.js and gatsby is struggling because of huge resources. 2MB of page weight and ~700Kb of JavaScript among it can definitely impact performance scores and results, especially for average mobile devices and slow networks. Also, heavy usage of styled-components for Next.js and Gatsby sites might be the cause (there are several researches in areas of performance downgrades). Good signal is that Image adoption of next gen image formats is growing. It will improve UX for end users in the long run.

## Conclusion

Despite missing data like headless CMSs, or some SSGs (Eleventy or Next.js detection mode) we were able to analyze a lot of information. Jamstack trend is growing year over year. Now more than 1% of all websites are Jamstack based.

We know that Next.js covers more than the half of Jamstack sites. It's not only trending, but also used in 13% of the top 1000 sites. Other popular SSGs are Nuxt.js and Gatsby. These are new players, just several years in the area but solidified their place by good usage among top ranked sites as well.

All SSGs are greatly used around the world, for example Western Europe together with Northern Europe have more than 20K sites with 1.4% of Jamstack adoption which is more than the territory it's invented. Also, fast-growing regions adopt Jamstack technology even faster and covering up to 4% of their sites.

Performance of Jamstack sites require knowledge of best practices and experienced developer level to achieve good results, but SSGs work on solutions out of the box will improve that area. Hope you enjoyed the data and give it a try using Jamstack.
