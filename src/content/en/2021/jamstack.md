## Introduction

 <figure>
  <blockquote>Jamstack has revolutionized the way we think about building for the web by providing a simpler developer experience, better performance, lower cost and greater scalability.</blockquote>
  <figcaption>â€” <cite><a hreflang="en" href="https://jamstack.wtf/">Jamstack.wtf</a></cite></figcaption>
</figure>

Jamstack stands on JavaScript, API, and Markup architecture. These 3 foundations are decoupled and the Jamstack site can be built purely using markup. Using pure HTML is "kinda" Jamstack, but it's really hard to scale. Lucky for us, there's a huge ecosystem of Static Site Generators (SSGs).

JavaScript based:
* Next.js
* Gatsby
* Nuxt.js
* etc

Old-fashioned:
* Eleventy
* Hugo
* Jekyll
* Hexo
* etc

And <a hreflang="en" href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">there are many more SSGs beyond these</a>. They allow building sites converted to "pure" HTML and JavaScript goodness if needed.

For more complex sites, data has to be structured. There are several ways to store and manage data using <a hreflang="en" href="https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/">headless CMSs</a> via APIs.

Moreover, Jamstack sites need support for server interactions. Like form submittions or user input processing. Services like Netlify provide <a hreflang="en" href="https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/">serverless functions</a> support to address this need.

The goal of this chapter is to identify what's the main SSGs used on Jamstack and look at adoption of Jamstack technology year over year. We look at how they are distributed around the world, what is the performance of Jamstack sites and how it is growing. We also explore data of different CDN providers for Jamstack sites. We also dive into results of resources used for Jamstack sites and their impact on user experiance.

It's worth to mention some data disclaimers to consider when reading this chaper:
1. HTTP Archive data of detected SSGs is based on Wappalyzer technology, which has some limitations. It can't detect whether the site was built with certain SSG such as Eleventy. Also, it can't detect if the site was generated by Next.js <a hreflang="en" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended">Static Rendering</a> or <a hreflang="en" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering">Server Side Rendering</a>.
2. In our analysis, we can't get any info related to headless CMSs, hence we will not cover this either.
3. We visualise SSG data using top 5 used SSGs based on number of sites built with these SSGs.

Most of the data is represented for mobile and desktop websites. There's a fully described [methodology](./methodology) used in HTTPArchive.

## Adoption of SSGs

SSG adoption year over year in general is growing 2x times. In 2019 it was just 0.4% mobile and 0.3% desktop sites. In 2020 the number almost doubled, to 0.6% on mobile and 0.7% on desktop sites. In 2021 they have grown again: 1.1% of mobile and 0.9% of desktop sites.
That underlines the trend of that technology. For example, this year a company like Vercel raised a $104M series C round and $150M in round D of investment to build a better web with modern technologies like Next.js. Also Jamstack oriented CDN provider Netlify raised $105M in their series D of investment. Hence, it's expected that numbers of Jamstack adoption will grow even higher next year.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="year-over-year-adoption.png",
  caption="SSG adoption year over year",
  description="Bar chart represents adoption year over year. Adoption year over year in general is growing 2x times.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1588757197&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="874607830",
  sql_file="ssg_compared_to_2020.sql"
) }}

In 2020 the amount of desktop websites increased 2.76 times, while mobile just 1.5 times. In 2021 mobile availability for SSGs built sites became way better than in 2020, and this year there are ~1.9 times more sites than 2020.

## Which SSGs are the most popular

{{ figure_markup(
  image="adoption-share.png",
  caption="SSG adoption share",
  description="Pie chart represents adoption share between SSGs. Nuxt.js covers 52.6% of Jamstack sites. Next.js is in second place with 36.8%, third one is Gatsby with 6.7%, followed by Hugo at 2.5%.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=2020451260&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1005292860",
  sql_file="adoption.sql"
) }}

Let's start with understanding which SSG is most popular. Nuxt.js covers 52.6% of Jamstack sites. Next.js is in second place with 36.8%, third one is Gatsby with 6.7%, followed by Hugo at 2.5%.

All top 3 SSGs are JavaScript based: Next.js and Gatsby use <a hreflang="en" href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a> at it's core and supplements this by adding their own functionality on top of it. Nuxt.js is based on <a hreflang="en" href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a>. Having these popular front-wnd frameworks, with huge ecosystems out of the box, makes development way easier. <a hreflang="en" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> allows Javascript to run on the server, as well as the browser where it has traditionally been used, enabling developers stick to one language. That makes adopting these SSGs easier from server perspective, comparing to Hugo which is based on the <a hreflang="en" href="https://go.dev/">Go programming language</a>, and Jekyll based on <a hreflang="en" href="https://go.dev/">Ruby</a>.

We will take a look what's the adoption rate of SSGs among web sites.

### Adoption by rank

{{ figure_markup(
  image="rank-adoption.png",
  caption="SSG adoption share by rank",
  description="Bar chart represents adoption share between SSGs for different ranked sites. ext.js shows great results when exploring data of popular sites. 13% of the top 1000 sites are Next.js. Nuxt.js has 5% and Gatsby 0.2%.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1137882647&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1005292860",
  sql_file="adoption.sql"
) }}


Next.js remains a popular SSG for top 10K. In the top 100K Next.js and Nuxt.js remain equal. Really interesting that Gatsby keeps all numbers pretty equal across all sites categories.


## Geographic adoption

In this section we will go over geographic adoption for Jamstack. Explore distribution over countries and regions.

### Adoption by country

SSGs are heavily used around the world, here're 10 countries with the highest number of sites.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-adoption-by-country.png",
  caption="SSG adoption by country",
  description="Bar chart represents SSG adoption by country. SSG adoption year over year in general is growing 2x times.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=778184046&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1956913376",
  sql_file="adoption_by_geo.sql",
  width=600,
  height=540
) }}

In the USA 1% of all sites pages, which is about 22K pages for desktop and 16K for mobile, are created with SSG. India has a lower number of pages, just 6K for desktop and 7K for mobile, but 1.7% of all pages is covered by Jamstack technologies. Third is United Kingdom, which also has 1.7% of pages.

It's really interesting to explore the individual SSGs distribution over countries.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-distribution-by-country.png",
  caption="SSG distribution by country",
  description="Bar chart represents SSG distribution by country. Next.js has higher adoption over Nuxt.js and Gatsby in almost all countries.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=533375815&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1956913376",
  sql_file="adoption_by_geo.sql"
) }}

USA has Next.js adoption over Nuxt.js and Gatsby. It keeps trending in almost all countries. In most countries, Next.js is a preferable choice. Interestingly that Gatsby has no data for 3 of the top 10 countries using Jamstack technologies, but in 2 of them Japan and Russian Federation Nuxt.js is more preferable.

### Adoption by region

Trend over countries applies for regions, that's interesting as well.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-adoption-by-region.png",
  caption="SSG distribution by region",
  description="Bar chart represents SSG distribution by region. Europe has 1.1%, Americas 1.2%, Asia 1.45%, Oceania 2.19% and Africa 2% among all sites by region.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=805975078&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1779595527",
  sql_file="adoption_by_region.sql"
) }}

The number of sites in Europe for desktop is 23K versus mobile 26K, that's 1.1% of all web sites in that region. In the Americas, there're 26K desktop sites versus 24K mobiles sites, 1.2% of sites. In any case, Europe has tiny bit lower adoption of Jamstack than the Americas. Asia has almost the same numbers, 21K desktop and 22K mobile as leading regions but greater Jamstack adoption, 1.45%. We saw that overall site adoption is 1.1%, but looks like Asia is going further with it and drives trends there.

Oceania and Africa have way lower overall numbers, but they have way greater Jamstack adoption. Oceania 2.19% and Africa 2%.

### Adoption by subregion

Subregions give us good enough granularity and some exciting data.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-adoption-by-subregion.png",
  caption="SSG distribution by sub region",
  description="Bar chart represents SSG distribution by sub region. Median values are aroun 1.1% among all sub region. Only subregions with lower number of sites in general adopt technology even broader, like 4.8% of Micronesia sites.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=4263440&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="72886421",
  sql_file="adoption_by_subregion.sql",
  width=600,
  height=794
) }}

It's not a surprise that first in a list stands for Northern America and USA location and driver of technologies. Most companies who invented SSGs are in the USA. But surprisingly, Western Europe is in second place and has 10K SSG mobile sites versus 17k for Northern America, but almost the same adoption level, 1.1%.

The tail also shows great results. Subregions with lower number of sites in general adopt technology even broader, like 4.8% of Micronesia sites.

### Summary of adoption by regions

SSG technology is adopted not only by places where it's invented and popularized, but also all around the world. Moreover, in places where the next generation of the web will be built, it grows even faster, mostly 2 times and sometimes 4 times, compared to others.

## SSGs distribution among CDN providers

We described how SSGs are adopted in different countries, so let's analyse which SSG is most popular among different CDN providers.

There's 7 most popular CDN providers for SSGs

* Netlify
* Vercel
* Cloudflare
* AWS
* Azure
* Akamai
* GitHub

Jamstack CDN services are not just for network delivery. They provide a lot of functionality to allow developers to easy deploy and manage Jamstack sites. For example, Netlify provide easy to use functionality to deploy sites in scope of their service so developers can just update the code and the continuous deployment process is managed for them. <a hreflang="en" href="https://bejamas.io/compare/netlify-vs-vercel/">Jamstack CDNs provide many other features</a> such as _serverless functions_, _A/B testing_ etc.
  
On the other hand, Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS are used not only for pure serving as CDN either, but can also provide protection service, DNS balancing etc. However, since we can't detect how exectly Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS are used, results could be false positives if we look at them as Jamstack enablers, since the "Jamstack" part could be handled on origin servers and so not actually on these services.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-distribution-over-cdn.png",
  caption="SSG distribution over CDN",
  description="Bar chart represents SSG distribution over CDN.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1366870673&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1565107748",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_distribution.sql"
) }}

Next.js, as most popular by data we have, mostly served by Cloudflare, Vercel, and AWS. Most of Gatsby's sites use Netlify, AWS, and Cloudflare.
Nuxt.js sites preferred to be served by Cloudflare, AWS, and Netlify. Hugo mostly uses Netlify, and Jekyll as no surprise mostly on GitHub.

On the following graph we show the relative split of CDNs used for popular CDNs:

{{ figure_markup(
  image="ssg-distribution-over-cdn-stacked.png",
  caption="SSG distribution over CDN",
  description="Stacked Bar chart represents SSG distribution over CDN.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=180251589&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1565107748",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_distribution.sql"
) }}

Next.js is mostly served by Vercel (the company that invented Next.js). We can see that more generalised CDNs like AWS are not serving significant percentages of Jamstack sites, as opposed to more Jamstack-focussed services like Netlify and Vercel.

GitHub as CDN provider might seem unusual, but <a hreflang="en" href="https://pages.github.com/">_GitHub Pages_</a> allow users to deploy sites on github.io subdomains built in Jekyll SSG.

## User experiance and performance

In our research we want to explore what's real user experaince for the 1.1% of sites that have adopted Jamstack technology. We will take a look at Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals results.

### Lighthouse

All Lighthouse scores are simulated testing data from our crawl. Hence, real-user results might be influence depending on the mobile data providers and devices actually used.

#### Performance score

{{ figure_markup(
  image="median-lighthouse-performance-score.png",
  caption="Median Lighthouse performance score",
  description="Bar chart represents median Lighthouse performance score.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1829586779&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="745310638",
  sql_file="median_lighthouse_score.sql"
) }}

Median performance score for all SSGs across mobile varies. The top 3 SSGs with data can't even pass 40 score. Since they are pretty much popular in top ranking sites, and distributed all around the world, as we saw on data before, we can assumed that they are used across many different devices and networks. We can expect more out-of-the-box improvements like <a hreflang="en" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization">Next.js image component</a> to help performance.

Jekyll is a stand out, achieving a score of almost 70 which is a great result for such a mastodon in the SSG area. Learn more about <a hreflang="en" href="https://web.dev/lighthouse-performance/">Lighthouse performance audit</a> to understand exactly what measures are included in this score.

#### Accessibility score

Lighthouse also runs <a hreflang="en" href="https://web.dev/lighthouse-accessibility/">audits to measure accessibility</a> and here we seem to have better results:

{{ figure_markup(
  image="median-lighthouse-accessibility-score.png",
  caption="Median Lighthouse accessibility score",
  description="Bar chart represents median Lighthouse accessibility score.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1270511864&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="745310638",
  sql_file="median_lighthouse_score.sql"
) }}

There are limits to what can be checked in an automated accessibility check, but this is still positive. Read the [Accessibility](./accessibility) chapter for more on this subject.

#### SEO score

{{ figure_markup(
  image="median-lighthouse-seo-score.png",
  caption="Median Lighthouse SEO score",
  description="Bar chart represents median Lighthouse SEO score. All Jamstack sites provide great SEO scores. From 90 to 92.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=813819935&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="745310638",
  sql_file="median_lighthouse_score.sql"
) }}

Similarly, all Jamstack sites provide great SEO scores from 90 to 92. Using static content always was SEO-friendly technique by default. Moreover, SSGs allow additional out of the box functionality to optimize sites for search engines.

The bottomline here is that Lighthouse results in general are good, but performance and PWA should be the main target for SSGs, these categories need some work to improve developer experience out of the box, hence the end result of sites performance will be improved.

## Core Web Vitals

<a hreflang="en" href="https://web.dev/learn-web-vitals/">Core Web Vitals</a> (CWV) is an initiative to provide unified guidance for quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web. CWV itself uses 3 performance metrics:

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - which measures the load time of the presumed main content of the page.
- First Input Delay (FID) - which measure interaction delays.
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) - which measures visual stability so content is not moving around as the page loads and the user reads the content.

We use the _Chrome UX Experience Report_ (CrUX) which gathers real-user data of these values and so is a better measure of actual user experience than the lab-based performance metric that Lighthouse provides.

We analysed data for the SSGs, but this also reflects how those are delivered. As we saw above some sites are used more or less on different CDNs which may have a better (or worse!) impact on performance because of that so we also look at that data.

In overall assessment for SSGs we can understand the basic performance level of Jamstack sites. CWV assessment contains data of 75% percentile of page loads which have a good score of CWV across all metrics.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="cwv-compliance.png",
  caption="Real-user Core Web Vitals compliance",
  description="Bar chart represents real-user Core Web Vitals compliance",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=93861885&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1340534640",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_passing.sql"
) }}

Looking at mobile results, Jekyll and Hugo have the best results over SSGsâ€”33% and 32% of all sites scored good. Gatsby is third with 21%, but it's the first of the JavaScript-based SSGs. Next.js with 15% of good performance pagesm and Nuxt.js has 11%.

### Largest Contentful Paint

The <a hreflang="en" href="https://web.dev/lcp/">Largest Contentful Paint</a> (LCP) metric reports the render time of the largest image or text block visible within the viewport, relative to when the page first started loading.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="cwv-lcp.png",
  caption="Real-user Core Web Vitals LCP",
  description="Bar chart represents real-user Core Web Vitals LCP",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=950243115&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1340534640",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_passing.sql"
) }}

Above we see the same results are approved by percent of sites with good LCP experience. The best results show Jekyll and Hugo with 79.5% and 72.5% of mobile sites having a "good" LCP of under 2.5s. The JavaScript based SSGs (Gatsby, Next.js, and Nuxt.js) fair worse.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="LCP-distribution-CDN.png",
  caption="LCP distribution for CDNs",
  description="Stacked Bar chart represents LCP distribution for CDNs",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1326237133&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1024061881",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_distribution.sql"
) }}

GitHub tops the stats when measuring on CDN level, likely reflecting the simpler sites hosted here. Netlify, a Jamstack-oriented CDN, comes next with 64% of sites having a good LCP and Vercel with 62% followed by AWS and Cloudflare at 57% and 51%.

### First Input Delay

<a hreflang="en" href="https://web.dev/fid/">First Input Delay</a> (FID) measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (i.e. when they click a link, tap on a button, or use a custom, JavaScript-powered control) to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response to that interaction.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="cwv-fid.png",
  caption="Real-user Core Web Vitals FID",
  description="Bar chart represents real-user Core Web Vitals FID.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1366681808&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1340534640",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_passing.sql"
) }}

On real user experience, All SSG show gret FID results too across different SSGs.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="FID-distribution-CDN.png",
  caption="FID distribution for CDNs",
  description="Stacked Bar chart represents FID distribution for CDNs",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1242431240&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1024061881",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_distribution.sql"
) }}

All CDNs deliver Jamstack sites with 90% good FID, though intersting that the CloudFalre and AWS sites fare slightly worse than the Jamstack-orientated CDNs.

### Cumulative Layout Shift

<a hreflang="en" href="https://web.dev/cls/">Cumulative Layout Shift</a> (CLF) is a measure of the largest burst of _layout shift scores_ for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of a page.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="cwv-cls.png",
  caption="Real-user Core Web Vitals CLS",
  description="Bar chart represents real-user Core Web Vitals CLS.",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=440775226&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1340534640",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_passing.sql"
) }}

Again, Jekyll shows great performance here. 81.6% of mobile are good results. Followed by Hugo at 73.4%, Gatsby at 66.7%, Next.js at 55.1%, and Nuxt.js trailing the pack at 46.4%%.

Here's the same results as with previously for CDNs. Github, Netlify, Vercel.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="CLS-distribution-CDN.png",
  caption="CLS distribution for CDNs",
  description="Stacked Bar chart represents CLS distribution for CDNs",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=692647280&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="1024061881",
  sql_file="core_web_vitals_distribution.sql"

In general CWV results reflect Lighthouse results. Huge and Jekyll have better real user performance data. We can't detect how complicated sites were built with these SSGs. I can bet that with modern SSGs like Next.js, Nuxt.js, Gatsby there are a lot of JavaScript delivered, more data to render including images. Hence, it affects performance results. Nevertheless, an interesting correlation between GitHub and Jekyll, which in tandem shows great results.

## Resources

Let's dive into resource weights between top fives SSGs to understand their influence on performance. The results represent median values.

### Resources weight

  sheets_gid="984097158",
  sql_file="resource_weights.sql"
) }}

JavaScript based SSGs have almost 2x larger amount of resources then Hugo and Jekyll. Top one is ~2MB for Nuxt.js, followed by Next.js and Gatsby with almost 1.8MB and 1.7MB.

As we mentioned above, JavaScript-based SSGs include JavaScript frameworks out of the box. That makes development easier, but requires more responsibility. The JavaScript ecosystem makes it ease to add more and more libraries to a site, for various purposes, which can lead to large bundle sizes.

### JavaScript

  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=727314511&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="984097158",
  sql_file="resource_weights.sql"
) }}

A big chunk of resources are for JavaScript. Again, for JavaScript-based SSGs it's a much bigger compared to others - around 700 KB compared to around 150 KB for non-JavaScript based SSGs. While this is not surprisingly, it's interesting to see the actual differences laid out in this way. Next.js based sites use more JavaScript than others. Hugo and Jekyll developers on other hand seem to be using JavaScript more reponsibly and keeping their bundles tight. Another reason for that might be site complexity. Hugo and Jekyll sites are not represented as much in top ranking sites, so they might have simplier use cases than, for example, Next.js sites which do appear more often in the top ranking sites.

We analysed which third party libraries were used among SSGs. We excluded React and Vue to have a clear picture of other libraries and frameworks represented among SSGs.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="3rd-party-libs-distribution-over-ssgs.png",
  caption="JavaScript 3rd parties distribution over SSGs",
  description="Stacked Bar chart represents JavaScript 3rd parties distribution over SSGs",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=972731684&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="434923317",
  sql_file="framework_libraries.sql"
) }}

A big surprise for us was jQuery. It wasn't a surprise that it's used for Hugo and Jekyll based sites (more than 60%), but that it's used inside React and Vue based sites wasn't expected! Next.js, Many Nuxt,js, and Gatsby sites use jQuery too.

Styled-components was used for Next.js - 20% and Gatsby takes 34%% from all of third party libraries. Nuxt.js sites almost don't use it.

Lodash is heavily used and was present among all SSGs up to 10% for Gatsby.

### CSS

{{ figure_markup(
  image="median-css-weight.png",
  caption="Median CSS weight",
  description="Bar chart represents median CSS weights",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=1274478265&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="984097158",
  sql_file="resource_weights.sql"
) }}

On the other hand, CSS is slightly heavier than Hugo and Jekyll.
Since of the benefits of styled-components is clean none duplicated CSS, it can be a good explaning why CSS size for these JavaScript SSGs are lower. One more hypothesis, old fashined SSGs use old fashion way for handling interactions and animations using CSS. JavaScript based, use more JavaScript in ganaral, hence might use it to relpace functionlity can be implemented with CSS.
### Images

Images weights distributed differently. There's no correlation between SSG groups.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="median-image-weight.png",
  caption="Median image weight",
  description="Bar chart represents median image weights",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=707866311&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="984097158",
  sql_file="resource_weights.sql"
) }}

Nuxt.js has the highest value at 645Kb. Then Hugo, 522Kb. Next.js and Gatsby almost the same, 465Kb and 545Kb. Jekyll has the lowest value at 295Kb.

#### Images format adoption

Images are one of the bottlenecks of good User Experience (UX). If they are large, then the user has to wait for a long time for the image to be delivered. It can lead to layout shifts and other problems.

{{ figure_markup(
  image="image-adoption.png",
  caption="Adoption of image format",
  description="Bar chart represents adoption of image format",
  chart_url="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRUiAdcUCSYyS7cQcQlE9uKeMSacgRudtf4pFRkIKKCt8Nw18qOod6TaAUL7tfm8pUbCPKShEN0jJOS/pubchart?oid=470820948&format=interactive",
  sheets_gid="626634977",
  sql_file="adoption_of_image_formats_in_ssgs.sql"
) }}

As one of the newer generation of image formats, <a hreflang="en" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/">WebP</a> has 17% of usage among Jamstack sites. Compared to [last year's results](../2020/jamstack#image-formats), when WebP had only 3%, we can say it's a great improvement over one year.

Still, the most used is JPEG at 29% and GIF at 27%. SVG is used on 19% of webpages.

### What the resources tells us

This analysis of resource weights confirms that performance of Next.js, Nuxt.js and Gatsby are likely struggling because of huge resources. 2MB of page weight and ~700Kb of JavaScript amongst that will definitely have an impact on performance scores, especially for average mobile devices and slower networks. Heavy usage of styled-components for Next.js and Gatsby sites <a hreflang="en" href="https://pustelto.com/blog/css-vs-css-in-js-perf/">might be another cause of of lesser performance</a>. A positive signal is that image adoption of next-generation image formats is growing, and this should improve UX for end users in the long run.

## Conclusion

Despite limitations on not being able to include headless CMSs, and for some well-known SSGs (Eleventy or Next.js detection mode), we still have a lot of data to analyze here to draw some interesting conclusions. The Jamstack trend is growing year over year: now more than 1% of all websites are Jamstack based.

We know that Next.js covers more than the half of measurable Jamstack sites. It's not only trending, but also used in 3.8% of the top 1,000 sites followed by the other popular SSGs such as Nuxt.js and Gatsby. These are all relatively new players, just few years in the space but they have solidified their place by good usage among top ranked sites as well.

SSGs are used all around the world, and are not confined to those countries with the founding companies of this model are based. In fact it seems that some of the fastest-growing adoptors of Jamstack technology, with up to 5% of sites, are those regions furthest away from the tech hubs of Silicon valley.

Like all websites, maintaining good performance of Jamstack sites requires knowledge of best practices and experienced developer level to achieve good results, but SSGs can improve this by working on out-of-the-box solutions to improve in that area. Hope you enjoyed the data and give it a try using Jamstack.
