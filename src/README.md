## Run Locally

Make sure you run the following commands from within the `src` directory by executing `cd src` first.

[Source](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/quickstart)

1. If you don't have virtualenv, install it using pip.

```
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

2. Create an isolated Python environment, and install dependencies:

```
virtualenv --python python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```
python main.py
```

4. In your web browser, enter the following address: http://127.0.0.1:8080


5. Run the tests:

If you want to run all the tests, use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/):

```
pytest
```


If you want to have the tests continue running (for example, while writing new tests), use [pytest-watch](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-watch/):

```
ptw
```

## Generating chapters

The chapter generation is dependent on nodejs, so you will need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed as well. All of the following commands must be run from within the `src` directory by executing `cd src` first.

1. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Run the generate chapters script:

```
npm run generate
```

3. For generating PDFs of the ebook, you need to install Prince. Follow the instructions on [the Prince Website](https://www.princexml.com/).

4. To actually generate the ebooks, start your local server, then run the following:

```
npm run ebook_2019_en
npm run ebook_2019_ja
```

(TODO: make this a script to handle all languages and years at some point)

It is also possible to generate the ebook from the website, with some optional params (e.g. to print it!)

```
prince "https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/ebook?print&inside-margin=4cm" -o web_almanac_2019_en.pdf --pdf-profile='PDF/UA-1'
```

Note `--pdf-profile='PDF/UA-1'` may not be needed if just intend to print.

Params accepted are:

- print - this ads left, right pages, footnotes, and sets roman numerals for front matter page numbers and adds footnotes. It is used by default when running `npm run ebook_2019_en` but we could change that if prefer a less print-like ebook.
- page-size - this allows you to override the default page size of A4
- inside-margin - this allows you to set an inside margin for binding (e.g. on right for left hand pages and vice versa)

You can also download the HTML and override the inline styles there if you want to customise this for something we haven;t exposed as a param.

## Deploying changes

If you've been added to the "App Engine Deployers" role in the GCP project, you're able to push code changes to the production website.

_Make sure you have generated the ebooks PDFs as that currently requires some extra steps that are not automated!_

1. Install the [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) Google Cloud SDK.

2. Authenticate the email address associated with the project with the `webalmanac` GCP project:

```
gcloud init
```

3. Stage the changes locally:

```
git checkout production
git status
git pull
git pull origin master
git push
```

  - Check out the `production` branch
  - Run `git status` to ensure you don't have any uncommitted changes locally
  - Merge any remote changes (both origin/production and origin/master branches)
  - Push the merge-commit back up to origin/production

4. Browse the website locally as one final QA test, then deploy the changes live:

```
npm run deploy
```

5. Browse the website in production to verify that the new changes have taken effect
