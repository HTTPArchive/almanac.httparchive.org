# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
# Note we are also using this for zip ignore in deploy.sh, so have to be a little
# bit more verbose than gcloud demands, to exclude items

.gcloudignore

# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
