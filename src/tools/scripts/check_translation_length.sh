Usage: ${0##*/} [-p]
Test that all translations are the same length as the English versions in main branch.
This is a good check to ensure translation is complete and no recent changes have been missed.
If a commit is given then only markdowns changed are tested otherwise all.

    -h   display this help and exit
    -a   test all files
    -v   print extra debug messages
