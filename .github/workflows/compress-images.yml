## Calibre Image Action  ##
###########################
#
# This runs the calibre GitHub action to compress our images
#
# This Action has a few different methoids for running:
# 1) For Pull Requests from and to the main repo it can run and update the PR
# 2) For pushes to main, it will run and create a new PR. This captures PR from
#    Forks.
# 3) It also runs every sunday at 11pm in case anything else sneaks in or any
#    improvements are added to Calibre. This will also open a PR if necessary.
# 4) Finally it can be kicked off manually and it will open a PR if necessary.
